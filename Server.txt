✅ 1. Test Backend (FastAPI)

Visit:

http://64.226.118.82:8000/docs

This is the Swagger UI. Test endpoints like:

/insert-record/

/semantic-search/

Make sure .env contains your valid OPENAI_API_KEY or those endpoints will fail with OpenAI-related errors.


✅ 2. Test Frontend (React)
Visit:

http://64.226.118.82:5173

This will show your React app. If it's blank or fails to connect to the API:

Make sure VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 is correctly set

You may need to rebuild the frontend with the correct API URL


✅ 3. Access Adminer (PostgreSQL GUI)
Visit:

http://64.226.118.82:8080

Login with:

System: PostgreSQL

Server: postgres

Username: postgre

Password: areesha

Database: unified_db

This lets you inspect the unified_index table.
