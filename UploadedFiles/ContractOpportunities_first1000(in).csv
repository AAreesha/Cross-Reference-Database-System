The Defense Health Agency Contracting Activity (DHACA), Western Markets Contracting Division (WMCD), San Diego, intends to award a firm fixed price contract for Blank Purchase Agreement (BPA) for Neonatal Total Parenteral Nutrition (Neo-TPN) and Methemoglobin Testing in support of Blood Bank Department, Naval Hospital Guam in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), only one source being available to meet the Government’s needs, to: Guam Regional Medical City (GRMC) 133 Route 3, Dededo, GU 96929 The neo-TPN and methemoglobin testing services are required to support the establishment of a new 3-bed Neonatal Stabilization Unit, which will provide 24/7 care for critical neonates for up to 10 days at NHG. GRMC is the sole hospital on the island of Guam that can support neonatal TPN and methemoglobin testing for neonatal critical care patients. Neo-TPN requires highly specialized formulations tailored to the unique nutritional needs of premature or critically ill infants. These formulations often involve specific concentrations designed for critically ill neonates. Neo-TPN solutions must be custom compounded to address the specific needs of each infant based on weight, gestational age, and medical condition. This level of customization and expertise in neonatal care is solely offered at GRMC. The island’s geographical location limits the availability of suppliers who can meet the stringent requirements of neo- TPN. Shipping logistics and distance prevent alternative suppliers from providing the specialized formulations required for critically ill neonatal patients. Methemoglobin testing requires specific equipment, reagents, and test kits available only at GRMC. The testing must be conducted on the island, and geographical isolation has limited the availability of multiple laboratory test centers. The Naval Hospital Guam (NHG) has identified GRMC as the only reliable testing center within reasonable transportation distance or logistical capability to perform the test. Methemoglobin testing and results are critical in urgent medical situations for critically ill infants, and GRMC is the sole hospital that can quickly provide the necessary services to meet immediate healthcare needs and ensure quality service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to provide the required product for United States Naval Hospital Guam. Capability statements shall not exceed six (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source purchase order. If a vendor challenges the basis of this requirement, please email capability statements as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Merlinda M. Labaco at Merlinda.m.labaco.civ@health.mil. The closing date for challenges is no later than 1:00 pm Pacific Standard Time, 30 January 2025. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS/OFFERS WILL BE HONORED"

Description 1.1. Overview The United State Department of Agriculture, Forest Service in support of (6) six forests in the California North Zone/Region 5 (Klamath National Forest, Lassen National Forest, Mendocino National Forest, Modoc National Forest, Shasta-Trinity National Forest and Six Rivers National Forest) is conducting a market survey to determine the interest, capability of Industry, expectant cost, necessary timeframe, and recommendations to provide mechanical vegetation manipulation essential for timber stand improvement and fuel reduction treatments. Vicinity maps identifying forest locations shall be included in the project task orders. Tasks may be located on the following forests listed above. 1.2 Request for Information Limitations THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party’s expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFQ or RFP, if any is issued. 2.0 Background The North Zone of Region 5 in California encompasses a diverse range of national forests that represent the rich ecological, cultural, and recreational resources of the region. These forests include the Klamath National Forest, Lassen National Forest, Mendocino National Forest, Modoc National Forest, Shasta-Trinity National Forest and Six Rivers National Forest. Spanning across Northern California, these forests offer a diverse array of landscapes, from rugged mountain ranges and volcanic plateaus to lush river valleys and dense old-growth forests. Home to diverse ecosystems supporting a wide variety of unique wildlife and plant species, including several rare and endangered varieties. These forests also provide critical watershed functions, ensuring clean water for surrounding communities and habitats. In addition to their ecological significance, the North Zone forests have deep cultural and historical importance, with ties to Indigenous tribes who have inhabited the area for thousands of years. They also offer abundant recreational opportunities, such as hiking, camping, fishing, and winter sports, making them valuable for both residents and visitors seeking to experience the natural beauty of Northern California. The importance of mechanical vegetation manipulation and fuel reduction treatments has become increasingly evident. These practices are vital for maintaining forest health and resilience, especially in the face of climate change and the growing intensity of wildfires in California. Mechanical thinning, prescribed burns, and other fuel reduction treatments help to reduce the build up of hazardous fuels, decrease wildfire severity, and protect communities and critical infrastructure. Additionally, these treatments promote growth of native vegetation, enhance wildlife habitat, and improve overall forest ecosystem function. Through sustainable forest management and conservation efforts, the forests in the North Zone of Region 5 collectively support biodiversity, environmental health, fire resilience and fostering community engagement with the natural world. 2.1.

NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE; requests for a solicitation will go unanswered. No award will be made from this Notice. Responses will be used to determine potential acquisition strategies, understand current market capabilities, and to gain knowledge of potential sources. GENERAL SCOPE: The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sacramento District (SPK) anticipates a potential requirement for design-bid-build construction services for levee improvements at Sacramento River Erosion (SRE) Site 1, located under the I-80 Pioneer Bridge in Sacramento, California (CA). The project is anticipated to reduce the risk of levee failure from an erosion related levee breach for approximately 1,000 feet along the Sacramento River. The project is anticipated to include several erosion protection measures located above and below the average low flow water surface elevation (~7 feet NAVD88 as defined) using rock bank protection to include a 3.5-foot-thick lens of launchable Graded Stone C below the water surface to protect the bank from scour and erosion as well as Graded Stone C extended above the water surface to the top of the bank under the Pioneer Bridge section. The project is anticipated to include a 3.5-foot-thick lens of soil-rock mix above the water surface to protect the bank from wave wash generated by boat wakes and wind waves, demolition and removal of the existing upper bank material under the I-80 Pioneer Bridge section to provide a suitable foundation for the Graded Stone C, and In-stream Woody Material (IWM) to be placed below the water line to create in-stream cover for fisheries throughout the seasons and provide flow deflection along the bank. With the exception of a small portion of work under the I-80 bridge, the work must be completed by barge. The potential requirement may result in a firm-fixed-price solicitation issued approximately March 2025. If solicited, the Government intends to award the anticipated requirement by May 2025. The Government estimates that construction of the potential requirement can be completed within one-hundred-eighty (180) calendar days from receipt of Notice to Proceed, and that in-water work will be limited to occur from July 1 through October 31, 2025. If market conditions indicate this estimate may be unrealistic, Respondents are encouraged to provide specific information (such as known equipment lead times or other timeline concerns) for Government consideration when responding to this Sources Sought Notice. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 36.204(g), the Government currently estimates the magnitude of construction for the potential project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the potential requirement is anticipated to be 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The small business size standard for the NAICS, as established by the U.S. Small Business Administration, is $45,500,000 annual revenue. The Product Service Code for the potential requirement is anticipated to be Y1LC, Construction of Tunnels and Subsurface Structures. If there is a reasonable expectation that at least two (2) responsible small business concerns under this NAICS can provide the anticipated services at fair market prices, the Contracting Officer is required to set the acquisition aside for small business concerns. If competition is set-aside for small businesses, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, requires that general construction small business Contractors self-perform at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials. If no set aside is made, the requirement is competed with full and open competition, and the awarded Contractor is not a small business, the Contractor will be required to self-perform the percent of work identified in the solicitation under FAR 52.236-1, Performance of Work by the Contractor. Contractors with the skill, capabilities, workload capacity, and ability to obtain bonding to complete the project described above (either through self-performance and/or Subcontractor management) are invited to provide capability statements to the primary point of contact listed below. Other than small businesses are also encouraged to submit Capability Statements. CAPABILITY STATEMENT: Responses must be limited to ten (10) 8.5 x 11 inch pages with a minimum font size of point 10. Please provide the following information: 1) Company name, System for Award Management Unique Entity Identification number (SAM UEID) or Employer Identification Number (EIN), address, point of contact name, contact phone number, contact e-mail address, and statement identifying whether the company employs union or non-union workers. 2) Experience and capability to complete contracts of similar magnitude and complexity to the potential requirement, including at least three (3) examples of comparable work performed within the past six (6) years. Each example should include a brief description of the project, description of the work performed (identification of self-performance and/or Subcontractor management), customer name, customer satisfaction, timeliness of performance, dollar value of the project, and whether there were any challenges experienced during the project (delays, investigations, health and safety issues, labor shortages, management/organizational issues, etc.). 3) Business size and socioeconomic type for the applicable NAICS (ex: Woman-Owned Small Business, Serviced-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), certified Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), 8(a) Participant, small business, or other than small business (large business)). 4) Bonding capability (in the form of a Surety letter). Please also provide the following information on projects completed in the last 2-5 years: A) Project Name and Location B) Detailed Project Description C) Initial Cost Estimate vs. Actual Final Cost D) Was the project completed on time? E) Number of craft trades present on the project F) Was a PLA used? G) Were there any challenges experienced during the project? Please submit all capabilities statements, information, brochures, and/or marketing material as one (1) document, limited to the page maximum above. Responses will not be considered an offer, proposal, or bid for any solicitation that may result from this Notice. Moreover, responses will not restrict the Government to an acquisition approach. This Notice is for information and planning purposes only. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any review conducted or the capability statements received.

Introduction. Statement of Work The purpose of this Statement of Work is to outline the tasks and responsibilities for the Human Performance Lab (HPL) to fulfill the specific objectives established in the project entitled Exercise-Induced Hypoalgesia in Women Veterans with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain: a Comparison of Low, Medium and High Intensity Interval Training. This project is funded by the VA s Health Services Research & Development (HSR&D) Pain/Opioid Consortium of Research (CORE) who strive to enhance collaboration and accelerate research related to nondrug interventions for chronic pain. This project will study the effect of various intensities of interval exercise on Women Veterans experience of post-exertional pain. The bouts of exercise are designed to take place in a state-of-the-art exercise physiology lab where participants will exercise on a cycle ergometer while the lab monitors heart rate, exertion, and pain. HPL must be a state-of-the-art physiology lab that has experience in conducting several NIH funded studies pertaining to exercise testing and training. Scope. Twelve participants will be recruited from the VA Portland Healthcare System s Women's Health Clinic (WHC). HPL will provide subjective matter expertise, technical skill and knowledge, and exercise testing capabilities. All tasks related to this project will be initiated by the contractor through strict adherence to the Joint OHSU/VA approved study protocols, approved on 3/19/2024. Specific Tasks. Enrollment of Veterans: Completion and maintenance of necessary trainings relevant to working with Veterans. Completion of screening questions via telephone to quantify duration, persistence, severity, and quality of pain to ensure study eligibility as described in the Joint IRB approved study protocols. Submission of documents to be added to the Joint IRB. Human Performance Lab Testing Collection of pain phenotype questionnaires at the onset of the study as outlined in the Joint IRB-approved protocol. Completion of interval exercise protocols as listed in the Join IRB-approved protocol: The exercise interventions are: (1) a low-intensity interval training protocol consisting of 1:00 rest to 1:00 exercise at 60-65% of estimated maximum heart rate, (2) a medium-intensity interval training protocol consisting of 2:00 rest to 1:00 exercise at 75-80% of estimated maximum heart rate, and (3) a high-intensity interval training protocol consisting of 4:00 rest to 1:00 exercise at 90-95% of estimated maximum heart rate. Maximum heart rate (HR max) will be calculated using the Tanaka equation (208 0.7 Ã— age) HR will be measured with a wearable chest-strap monitor. The participants will be encouraged to pedal the bicycle to maintain HR in goal range, and they may ask the research assistant to adjust the resistance of the cycle ergometer during the intervals if desired, but they will be encouraged to stop if they feel pain or do not feel safe. If they are not able to achieve the heart rate goals, they will be asked to make their best attempt. Collection of pain data: Before and after each intervention; obtain both a self-reported pain level and measure each participant s pressure pain threshold. Administer the well-validated Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form to assess pain severity and pain interference. This measure will be administered at all study assessments and at the beginning of exercise sessions. Ask participants about current pain at the beginning and end of bouts of exercise and at the post-exercise 48-hour follow-up via telephone call. -Collect pressure pain thresholds using a pressure algometer at the rectus femoris and first interosseous muscles. Each site will be measured 3 times; a mean will be used. Pain thresholds will be obtained within 2 to 6 minutes of the completion of exercise. Adverse Event Reporting 3.1 Modifications to the project s protocol will be submitted to the Joint OHSU/VA IRB for review and approval prior to implementation. 3.2 Serious adverse events will be reported to the PI who will notify, in writing, the IRB within 5 business days of becoming aware of the occurrence. 3.3 Nonreportable events and minor protocol deviations will be collected and reported nto the PI within 5 business days of being made aware of the occurrence.

What’s New? While the revamp of the MPP was underway, we used the opportunity to make necessary updates based upon the codification of the DHS MPP. Codification of the MPP: Like the legacy MPP, the codified MPP is designed to motivate and encourage large business prime contractor firms to provide mutually beneficial developmental assistance to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Inclusivity Expansion: All small businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), are now eligible to participate as protégés, fostering a more diverse environment for collaboration with the mentor and ultimately to DHS. Which Feature is the Same? The DHS MPP still encourages large businesses to assist and develop eligible protégés, thereby enhancing their capabilities leading to increased subcontracting and being more competitive for prime awards. It is also designed to: Improve the performance of contracts and subcontracts. Foster the establishment of long-term business relationships between large prime contractors, small business subcontractors, HBCU/MI partnerships. Strengthen subcontracting opportunities and accomplishments through incentives. How can I Participate? The application and basic steps necessary to establish a DHS Mentor-Protégé Agreement are posted on the website. More details about the DHS MPP can also be found in the MPP Guide. If you have questions or require additional information, contact the MPP team at dhsmpp@hq.dhs.gov. Thank you for your continued support for the DHS MPP. We look forward to working together to achieve our shared vision of excellence. NOTE: Some sections under the website are still being developed and will be posted soon."

Travel Arrangement Services and Federal Travel Regulation (FTR): Rail, Hotel, and Car Rental: The service will facilitate reservations for different modes of transportation and accommodation. This ensures that all aspects of the traveler’s journey are taken care of efficiently. Alternative Booking Methods: The service is designed to support scenarios where the CRS is down or when booking with airlines or providers that do not subscribe to a CRS. Last-Minute Reservations and Cancellations: The service will be equipped to handle urgent booking needs or last-minute changes, ensuring flexibility for travelers in time-sensitive situations. FTR Compliance: The review will focus on ensuring that travel expenses are appropriate, cost-effective, and align with federal guidelines. This helps in preventing improper reimbursements or misuse of government travel funds. Consistency with Approved Travel Authorization: This involves verifying that the selected travel options (e.g., flight, accommodation, car rental) fall within the guidelines of the approved travel authorization. Exception Handling: Special attention is given to scenarios where standard systems (like CRS) may not be applicable, such as when booking non-subscribed airline services or managing last-minute travel changes.

This RFI is following the Virtual Industry Day held on January 7, 2025, where the Government presented an overview of the AIS@P contract vehicle and discussed the need for additional market research and direct engagement with industry. The posting for the Industry Day, with attached slides presented that day, can be found here: https://sam.gov/opp/b6ad7c59539a49deabcd39bed465ea8b/view As outlined during the Virtual Industry Day, the Government is seeking to gather more information and input from industry to inform the development of the AIS@P MATOC. The purpose of this RFI is to gather input from potential offerors on the existing Draft Request for Proposal (RFP). The Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) can be found here: https://sam.gov/opp/c252bad14e5b4eddb53ef3dbea9b78f4/view One-on-One Sessions As part of this RFI, the Government intends to conduct one-on-one sessions with selected interested vendors. These sessions will provide an opportunity for industry to discuss their ideas, provide feedback, and ask questions related to the AIS@P MATOC. The one-on-one sessions are scheduled to begin after the date of this RFI posting. To participate in a one-on-one session, companies must submit a written request to the Contracting Officer and Contract Specialist no later than COB Friday, 24 January 2025. The request should include the company's name, general information, and a point of contact. Selection of Vendors for One-on-One Sessions Please note that due to resource constraints, the Government unfortunately does not have the capacity to meet with every responding vendor. However, we intend to hold 40 one-on-one sessions; 20 sessions for each of the two Requirements Pools (RPs): RP1 (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) and RP2 (Software). Vendors will be selected for one-on-one sessions based on their written submissions, responsiveness to the Government, the Government’s discretion to meet with vendors that appear to have information of interest to the Government, and with consideration given to ensuring a diverse range of participants. The Government reserves the right to hold more or fewer one-on-one sessions as the Government sees fit. Alternative Opportunity for Input Vendors that are not selected for a one-on-one session are encouraged to provide their written input and feedback on the AIS@P MATOC Draft RFP, to include any questions that vendors would like the Government to answer. Please submit your comments, questions, and suggestions via email to the AIS@P group mailbox, Contracting Officer, and Contract Specialist (contact information is below) by COB Friday, 31 January 2025. ACC-APG and PEO IEW&S are compiling all questions submitted, including those received prior to, and during, the Virtual Industry Day, and will post a Q&A file to SAM.gov once it is completed. We value your input and will consider all feedback received in developing the AIS@P MATOC. Objectives of One-on-One Sessions The general objectives of the one-on-one sessions are to: Increase industry understanding of government requirements Provide industry with an opportunity to surface perceived issues and concerns Allow the Government to hear industry responses and comments in general terms Enable the Government and industry to better understand each other's perspectives Allow industry to showcase their production-ready solutions The specific topics/questions the Government is requesting industry input on are: Sections L&M of the Draft RFP ( https://sam.gov/opp/c252bad14e5b4eddb53ef3dbea9b78f4/view ). After review of the Government’s Draft RFP does your company have feedback on the gate criteria for the sub-pools you are intending to propose to? In your opinion, what are ways to improve the gate criteria without eliminating meaningful competition? What is an example of a gate criteria that can be measured objectively? Are they any discriminators that the Government are missing for your sub-pool(s)? Important Notes Please note that the one-on-one sessions DO NOT: Provide industry an opportunity to brief their intended proposal Provide Government critique of potential offeror's intended approach Constitute initiation of the negotiation process The Government reserves the right to provide written responses to questions asked during the one-on-one sessions at a later date. Each one-on-one session will be limited to 45 minutes. Equal Access to Information If new information regarding this planned acquisition is released during the one-on-one sessions or in answer to written submissions, then the same information will be provided to all potential offerors, including those who do not attend the sessions. The Government will take care to avoid releasing contractor proprietary information and requests that contractors identify any proprietary information in their submissions. We look forward to receiving your feedback and input on the AIS@P MATOC. Please submit your written requests for one-on-one sessions or email your comments and suggestions to the below contacts by the dates indicated above.

NOTE: The offerors statement must clearly demonstrate that it meets the Government’s requirements.

Prior to beginning work, post and maintain at each work area all current emergency contact information, VA Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA)/Permit, Interim Life Safety Measures (ILSM), and other information required by VA and the GC project- specific safety plan, at all entry points to the work area. The target mobilization date is determined by first establishing the delivery date of the longest lead time material or system along the critical path, which in this project is predominantly HVAC equipment, but is likely to also consider shop-fabricated doors and frames, and then working back along the critical path listing all predecessor work activities. The baseline period of performance is certain to change between Initial Project Schedule and acceptance of the Final Project Schedule. The Contracting Officer, at his or her discretion and judgement, will issue a contract modification revising the period of performance end date. As there is no change to the quantity or quality of the work, the contract value shall not change. Performance of the Work: Erect and maintain a dust-tight containment around the work area which complies with applicable Code associated with UL-Rated wall assemblies and maintenance of egress paths. Containment shall enable access to the work, without obstructing access to adjacent suites or rooms. Establish HEPA air purification. Review and follow specification 01 35 33 Infection Control Requirements as applicable to this location and work. Follow PRA & ICRA plan and permit generated and issued by VA. Remove only upon completion approval of the COR. After establishing and gaining approval of the temporary modular hard plastic dust-tight construction dust control barrier system, including lockable door. Where this is the sole containment, include differential pressure monitoring for the work area, with monitor located adjacent to the temporary entry door. Where fire or smoke-rated wall assemblies are planned for alternation even if temporarily, provide a dust-tight 1-hour rated temporary construction wall with locking door to isolate the area of work, finished with one coat of paint on the outside were indicated. The 1-hour temporary wall shall include differential pressure monitoring for the work area, with monitor located adjacent to the temporary entry door. The 1-hour temporary wall and differential pressure monitoring must be complete and approved prior to removal of the (outer) temporary modular wall barrier, and commencement of demolition within the space. Prior to removal of a temporary fire or smoke-rated walls, completely restore rated wall assemblies required of the work, and then re-erect the temporary modular hard plastic, dust-tight, barrier system. In no case shall any containment be removed unless and until the work area, including the inside of the ventilation system, has been thoroughly cleaned and approved for progress toward activation. Immediately prior to turnover, remove all air filters from the ventilation system used during construction, and supply and install new specified filters. Supply case quantities of each filter to VA with the system. Perform selective demolition and construction as described in the specifications and drawings. Special Acceptance Criteria for the work shall include: HVAC system shall not be acceptable in whole or in part unless and until Testing, Adjusting, and Balancing (TAB) is completed and accepted in accordance with the Specifications, Drawings, and the current edition ASHRAE 170 Ventilation of Health Care Facilities (and errata) requirements specific to the room/suite type and purpose. VA reserves the right to conduct, or have conducted, verification testing, and deduct its cost from the contract if noncompliant conditions are found. The contractor shall provide EIA/TIA testing and certification of all new Cat 6a communications cable. Restore all finishes damaged during the work match existing. Thoroughly clean all surfaces using HEPA-filtered vacuum cleaner and anti-bacterial wipes. Part 4: Meetings, Submittals, and Deliverables: Kick-Off Meeting and Documentation The contractor s Project Manager and Field Supervisor shall attend a Preconstruction Safety and Coordination Meeting to discuss project details. Kick-Off Meeting Documentation: Prepare and submit for review and acceptance a DRAFT Critical Path Method (CPM) Baseline Schedule reflecting each phase and activity of the work beginning with mobilization, including each critical activity, and each essential task required to optimally meet the objectives of the project. The Baseline Schedule must also include all activities to be performed by VA, including maintenance shops support, safety and infection control, the AE, the Commissioning Agent, etc. It is expected that this timeline will list all activities of the work leading up to the delivery of long lead items, the target dates of long lead items, installation of long lead items, and each work activity that follows until all work is complete, compliant, and ready for acceptance. The durations of each phase will change once the GC completes all procurement activities and submit for review and approval the FINAL Baseline Schedule. To enable objective assessment of costs and progress, the Baseline Schedule shall be cost-loaded at each work activity (essentially Division 02 on), ensuring that the total cost of each phase and Division of work match the corresponding Schedule of Values, and the total of the construction contract at Award. Develop the CPM schedule in sufficient detail to enable readers to understand all planned activities, their predecessors, and successors, who is performing the work, durations, and costs. Activity durations shall not exceed two calendar weeks. Indicate resource SDVOSB status. The Project Manual index of specifications is a useful guide for starting the CPM schedule and Schedule of Values in sufficient detail. For example: Simply listing HVAC is unacceptable for projects including more than basic work in this category. The inclusion of specifications for an AHU, controls, ductwork, demolition of each, testing and balancing, etc. also prompt their inclusion as categories of activities and tasks in the schedule. In fact, for larger work categories, breaking down the cost by system/material and installation and testing enables partial payment for higher cost items upon delivery into the facility work area. Preparation and processing of submittals are GC procurement (administrative) activities and not work activities contributing to the compensable work in the field. Should the contractor elect to include submittal planning in their internal use schedule for their own purposes, do not show those line items in the schedule submitted to VA for consideration in the Baseline Schedule. Not less than one item per subcontractor at any tier. Subcontractors, by definition, are contributing work in the field to the project. Pass-throughs are not acceptable. Include all expected utility system shutdowns, road closures, crane lifts, and off- hours work in the CPM schedule. Do not include costs associated with non-work administrative activities inherent in the listed work items. The Government cannot pay for what it has not inspected and accepted as compliant, or for activities which add no value to VA facilities. Front-loading proposals, bids, schedules of values, and line-item costs of cost-loaded CPM schedules with non-work items puts the Contractor, the Government, and the Bonding Company at otherwise avoidable risk associated with paying out more than the value of work in place should the work stop prior to completion. Administrative and managerial activities associated with each Work line item are to be included in each line item, along with prorated overhead and profit. The contractor shall prepare and submit SF-1413 for each subcontractor to the CO, copying the COR. List of all subcontractors and suppliers, including Company names, office address, and main point of contact name with telephone number, and SDVOSB status. As required at 01 35 26 Safety Requirements: Develop and submit a Project- Specific Construction Safety and Accident Prevention Plan with project-specific procedures, processes, analysis, and details, including but not limited to: Access and use the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers EM 385-1-1 Safety and Health Requirements and its Appendix A Minimum Basic Outline for Accident Prevention Plans for development of meaningful, effective, and compliant project safety plans. Submission of generic, non-project specific safety plans will be rejected, resulting in a contractor-caused delay in commencement of the work. Project-specific Activity Hazard Analysis (AHA), which forms the basis of the Construction Safety and Accident Prevention Plan highlighting identified risks such as isolation of stored energy (Lock-Out*), fall protection, or confined space access. (*) Note that tag-out is not an acceptable form of isolation, therefore it was intentional not to use the term LOTO. Submit an electronic copy of the GC and all subcontractor competent persons OSHA 30-hour Construction Safety Training certificates with project-specific Construction Safety and Accident Prevention Plan. Submit an electronic copy of all workers OSHA 30-hour Construction Safety Training certificates or cards prior to allowing entry to the site. Assist the COR in completing project-specific VA Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA) and Interim Life Safety Measures (ILSM) documentation. Public Safety Compliance Requirements: The following applies to all VA and Navy properties, including leased facilities, regardless of building occupancy or current use and does not differentiate between medical or administrative spaces as all are occupied by people we are collectively working to protect from harm including contractor staff. Contractors shall adhere to and ensure compliance with federal laws, regulations, and Executive Orders regarding screening, vaccinations, and or testing designed to protect contractor employee and general public health and safety, as well as all associated health information and personally identifiable information. All contractor staff share a common moral responsibility to stay away from the facility when feeling ill. Quality Control Plan and Quality Assurance Plan: 01 40 00 Quality Requirements is included in its entirety in this contract. This specification is brief but very informative and enabling to those who approach it as an opportunity. Submittal Register (aka submittal log) is described in Quality Assurance of the above specification, and the Project Manual at 01 33 23. Submittal Register must list each submission listed in each and every specification. Because each project is different, do not recycle submittal logs from other projects. (Dis)Approval of a submittal never constitutes a change to the quantity, quality, cost, or duration of a contract. The General Contractor is solely responsible for submitting and delivering complete and compliant work. Defective work shall be removed and replaced at the contractor s expense. The Government has the right and responsibility to withhold funds equivalent to the cost for the Government to complete the work should the contractor fail to promptly act in executing the work or remedying defective work. To help prevent (unfortunately) common shortcomings and mistakes with submittal preparation and submission, as well as ensure that the installation of systems is complete and compliant, the GC shall provide the services of at least one licensed professional engineer to pre-review and certify as compliant all submittals and subsequent systems prior to requests for VA or its AE to review for compliance. For projects requiring alteration or replacement of mechanical systems, the GC consulting engineer is required to be a licensed mechanical engineer. Similarly, for projects with significant electrical scope, retain a licensed electrical engineer. The consulting engineer may be a firm. Engaging a verified SDVOSB firm is always encouraged. The consulting engineer (or firm) cannot be the AE of-Record or part of their consulting team. Upon issuance of Notice to Proceed, GC shall immediately submit to VA for review and information the contact information and credentials of the contracted consulting engineer.

The Daily Report shall include: List of issues or concerns, days remaining per the contract, detail regarding any safety incidents, detail of daily safety inspections (including items checked and corrective actions taken), notations regarding any visitors to the work area. Use of VA Form 10101 Contractor Production Report (fillable PDF at https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA10101.pdf) is required each day even on days with no contractor activity, which is what to report on such days. Contractor may and should provide more information than shown in the standard form, but the standard form is required. The report must be accompanied by relevant time and date-stamped photos of construction progress of sufficient quantity and detail to enable viewers to clearly see the progress of all work to-date, all issues discovered (including those which become the subject of RFI s). Email the VA Form 10101 Contractor Production Report and photos to the COR not later than 9 AM the next working day. No photography on VA premises is allowed without written permission of the COR. In no case shall the GC allow any team member to take photographs with patients, visitors, or employees in the picture.

Where manufacturer s warranties exceed one year, provide all documentation necessary for VA to exercise warranty rights beyond the standard GC warranty. Where specified, such as with roofing systems, provide the warranty written by the manufacturer to VA for the term specified or greater (typically 20 years). Note that moving furnishings or equipment into the space does not constitute occupancy or acceptance, however, damage to completed work during these activities shall be the responsibility of VA to correct. Lien Waivers and other documents required by the Contracting Officer. Part 5: Applicable Performance Standards All work shall comply with All VA and FHCC policies including and not limited to: VA Construction Safety and VA Infection Control Policies. Codes, Standards and Executive Orders (Topic 1) found at http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/cPro.asp 01 32 16.15 Project Schedules with Long Lead Items (D/B/B Projects at FHCC) 01 35 26 Safety Requirements 01 35 33 Infection Control Requirements 01 40 00 Quality Requirements 01 41 00 Regulatory Requirements 01 42 16 Definitions and Abbreviations Coordinating with VA-retained Commissioning Agent (CxA) and Architect-Engineer (AE). VA intends to retain the services of an independent CxA. AE field-verification and documentation of compliant systems remains an essential part of Construction Period Services. The General Contractor is responsible for communication and cooperation with the AE and CxA and enabling compliant execution of contracts. No action or inaction by the AE, CxA, VA, or other government agencies ever relieves the GC from responsibility to deliver 100% of the project requirements as specified and designed. The General Contractor shall have a Competent Supervisory Person on site at all times when any worker(s) or subcontractor(s) are present. The General Contractor is also required to maintain on site a competent Site Safety and Health Officer (see 01 35 26 Safety Requirements when any worker(s) or subcontractor(s) are present. The VA COR may, at his or her discretion, may allow the Competent Supervisory Person to also act at the SSHO, based on demonstrated competency and performance in the two roles. If demonstrated lack of competency or effectiveness in either role is observed, the VA COR may revoke the privilege. Safety: Prior to any activity, review the following with all project and craft team leaders: 01 35 26 Safety Requirements. The Contractor shall provide a proactive and complaint Construction Safety and Accident Prevention plan in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 01 35 26 Safety Requirements, and site-specific policies: All persons working on any electrical systems rated 50 volts or more shall have the minimum qualification as a State Licensed Master Electrician or Registered Journeyman Electrician, and all activities shall follow the safe work practices in compliance with NFPA 70E Electrical Safety in the Workplace. 01 35 26 Safety Requirements is included in its entirety in this contract. Each contractor-employer is required to be solely responsible for the health and safety of its employees in accordance with 29 CFR 1910, 1926, & 1960 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended. Because each contractor-employer is required to be solely responsible for the health and safety of its employees, part of a compliant and effective safety management program requires each employer to plan and implement their own compliant permit- required work including written permits. DO NOT rely on, or request that VA generate required permits such as Hot Work or Confined Space documents. Prior to the beginning of any work, fire extinguisher(s) complying with NFPA 10 shall be pedestal-mounted in the work area. Inspection of the work area includes verification that inspection tags are current. Where non-compliant, the contractor may be required to remove and replace the unit(s) before resuming work activity. All work in crawl spaces shall be planned and carried out as OSHA Permit-Required Confined Space. Immediately stop work and notify the COR if asbestos is noticed or suspected in the area of work. Exception: The above will not necessarily apply to areas where the documents call for abatement activities. This item is concerned with unplanned locations. Fire-seal all penetrations made or discovered through any wall or floor assembly with UL Listed fire-rated products or systems. Infection Control: 01 35 33 Infection Control Requirements is included in its entirety in this contract. Its construct is enabling for each condition experienced through each phase of the work. The following are high-level requirements most often found deficient during inspections yet required.

Award will be made in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-l(b) and the procedures at FAR Part 12 entitled, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 entitled, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. GreenWater Laboratories is, to the knowledge of the USGS, the only source who can provide the (MMPB) liver sample processing method. The USGS has long-term monitoring projects in place on the Snake River to estimate abundance, survival, and growth of juvenile fall Chinook salmon migrating through Lower Granite Reservoir. As part of this monitoring, the USGS is investigating if harmful algae blooms can have any health effects on the ESA listed juvenile fall Chinook salmon in the reservoir. The USGS has chosen to utilize the MMPB method for analyzing fish liver tissue over the ELISA method, due to the fact that the MMPB method can detect both bound and unbound toxins in the tissue, while the ELISA method can only detect bound toxins. The MMPB method is a relatively new technique for determining the presence of the Cynaotoxins. Currently GreenWater Laboratories is the only laboratory to offer fish tissue analysis using the MMPB method. The purpose of this notice is to satisfy the requirements of FAR Subpart 5.2.

Please see the updated file which now includes one additional question. INTRODUCTION: The United States Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), on behalf of Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications and Network (PEO C3N) is requesting information from industry for Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2). Potential Offerors are encouraged to subscribe for real-time e-mail notifications when additional information is posted to the SAM.Gov website. DISCLAIMER: THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY. PROGRAM BACKGROUND: NGC2 is a clean-sheet, fundamentally different approach for an Army-wide, data-centric transformation that enables our commanders to make more, faster, and better decisions than the enemy. NGC2 modernization is driven by continuous iteration of flexible requirements, vendor teaming and competition throughout the life cycle, and governance by an AFC product owner and ASA(ALT) program manager working together to plan and rapidly execute capability drops. This approach enables continuous integration and continuous deliver (CI/CD) of a secure, high performing, and adaptive technology stack for data and network architecture for varying operations in environments spanning from enterprise connected and cloud-enabled through austere and communication degraded. Delivering NGC2 will require process innovation across requirements, resourcing, acquisition and contracting. The Characteristics of Need, available separately on SAM.Gov and now includes a public NetModX update, are reflected in an open architecture, organized as a set of independent layers that rely on Government approved, non-proprietary APIs to interface and dialogue between them. Although independent, each layer is accessed by services that permit inter-layer functionality, such as orchestration that routes data differently in the transport layer depending on the availability of resources in the computer layer. The performance of each layer is improved through DevSecOps across the technology stack. The open interfacing between each layer provides continuous opportunity for technology insertion through competition and enables on-ramps and off-ramps for technology solution providers. At every echelon, the NGC2 ecosystem enables tactical edge survivability by allocating resources to optimize data orchestration and offer tailorability of commanders’ information needs REQUESTED INFORMATION: Respondents are requested to provide feedback/comments on draft documentation associated with NGC2 requirements. Draft documents to be released to industry via secure procedures include: 1. Base IDIQ Performance Work Statement (PWS) 2. Prototype Statement of Objectives (SOO) 3. RFI Questions Proprietary information and trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on all materials. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All personnel reviewing responses will understand their responsibility for proper use and protection from unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information as described 41 USC 423. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. COMPLIANCE: Attachments are provided for informational purposes only and will be removed from SAM.Gov after the RFI close date. The USG is generating clearance instructions for industry to receive attachments with CUI markings. A special notice may be separately posted in advance of release to maximize industry’s time for any restricted documents. Interested parties are encouraged to subscribe for real-time notifications if additional information is posted regarding document compliance. SUBMISSION DETAILS: Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI via the provided question excel file. Parties who wish to respond to this RFI should send responses via email no later than 23 January 2025 1600 EST to Contracting Officer Eric Roberts, eric.j.roberts48.civ@army.mil and Contracting Specialist MAJ Quentin Sica, quentin.sica.mil@army.mil."

Offeror's must acknowledge all five amendments in order for its proposal to be acceptable. All amendments issued to the solicitations apply to all Offerors regardless if they are new or have provided a proposal already; therefore, all Offerors must acknowledge them in some way. If the Offeror is providing a new proposal or chooses to resubmit their proposal, per addendum to 52.212-1, para. 6.0 they are required to either check the box in PIEE that confirms the Offeror acknowledges all the amendments or they shall provide all the SF30s signed with their proposal in PIEE to reflect their acknowledgement. Per Amendments 0003-0005, if the Offeror chooses to keep the proposal it already submitted, it must send the signed SF 30s for each amendment to PACTSIII@uscis.dhs.gov no later than 5:00pm (5:00:00pm) ET on May 31, 2024.

Acknowledging the amendments is the Offeror's admission that it understands the content of the amendments and that their proposal has taken the amendments into account and its proposal is in compliance with all the amendments. If the Offeror revalidated its original proposal by providing a signed SF30 via email in response to Amendment 0003, it only needs to send the SF30s for Amendment 0004 and 0005 via email if it chooses to continue to keep the proposal it originally submitted.

The intent of including “if applicable” after “contract number and line item” was meant to state, if the contract number and line item is available. To clarify this further, the DHS recognizes that including the contract number on a invoice and/or proof of payment may not be standard practice; therefore, the contract number may not be included on the invoice and/or proof of payment. If the contract number is missing from the invoice and/or proof of payment, the invoice and/or proof of payment will be acceptable forms of supporting documentation if the DHS is able to confirm the invoice and/or proof of payment provided is for the project/contract being claimed. 5/10/2024 Update: Amendment 0003 to 70SBUR24R00000001 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page, Part II - Contract Clauses, Part III – Terms and Conditions and Attachments, and Part IV – Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation (extended the proposal submission date). 5/8/2024 Update: The DHS intends on amending this solicitation, no later than May 10, 2024, to include the following updates: The addendums to 52.212-1 and 52.212-2 will be updated to allow Offerors that have Non-Federal projects and projects performed as a First-Tier subcontractor to submit paid invoices as means to substantiate the obligated amounts claimed. The addendum to 52.212-1, paragraph 4.3.1.2.1(d)(ii) will be updated to clarify what it means when an Offeror includes the NAICS code/Product Service Code on the Project Verification Form. The addendums to 52.212-1 and 52.212-2 will be updated to clarify what “at the time of” means as it relates to an adequate accounting system and acceptable facility clearance. Minor administrative corrections As a result of these updates, Contractors may, but are not required to, submit a full proposal in response to the Amendment 0003 no later than 5pm (5:00:00 pm) ET on May 21, 2024. If a contractor has already provided a proposal and it chooses to update/modify or add to their existing proposal, it must resubmit its proposal in PIEE in its entirety. However, if the Offeror chooses to keep the proposal it already submitted, it must send the signed SF 30 from Amendment 0003 to PACTSIII@uscis.dhs.gov no later than 5pm (5:00:00 pm) ET on May 21, 2024. Additionally, the Offeror must state in its email that its original proposal will remain valid from the time the email is sent to the period stated in its original Volume I cover sheet. If you did not submit a proposal or your proposal was provided after exactly 5:00pm (5:00:00 pm) Friday, April 12, 2024, you may submit a proposal no later than 5pm (5:00:00pm) ET on Tuesday, May 21, 2024. We highly recommend Offerors take this opportunity to review the proposals they submitted to ensure all required documents have been submitted and the Offeror used the Self-Scoring Sheet that corresponds to the Functional Category/ Solicitation the Offeror is proposing. If a Contractor chooses to submit a new or revised proposal, only include documents in the designated areas in the PIEE Offer Template. DO NOT include any documents in the catch-all “Attachments” area (after Volume IV) at the bottom of the template. Not abiding by this may result in a non-complaint proposal. Also, ensure you submit the correct versions of the Volume I Cover Sheet (Amendment 0001) and Project Cover Sheets (Amendments 0001 or 0002) when resubmitting. Lastly, please include a log of all changes/updates that were made between the original proposal submitted and the revised proposal in the “Proposal Table of Contents” folder in the PIEE template. If Contractors already provided a proposal and included documents in the “catch-all” or submitted the incorrect Volume I or Project Cover Sheets, they do not need to resubmit only to fix this error. However, if Contractors are providing new or revised proposals, we ask that they please abide by the instructions provided above. 4/12/2024 Update (Correction): There were errors made in the responses to questions 682, 692 and 696.

A request for an extension will not be granted. Attached are our responses to some of the questions (644 – 674) that we have received.

Additionally, it is our understanding that when files are saved and uploaded into the PIEE system that the special characters associated with the naming conventions required in Attachment 9 may not appear. Please continue to abide by the naming conventions required in Attachment 9. If the special characters are replaced with “_” or are omitted when the files are saved or uploaded to PIEE, Offerors will not be deemed non-compliant. However, Offerors must continue to abide by the naming conventions required in Attachment 9 regardless of this issue. 3/28/2024 - Update Amendment 0002 to 70SBUR24R00000001 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page, Part II - Contract Clauses, Part III – Terms and Conditions and Attachments, and Part IV – Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation (extended the proposal submission date), update the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) Offer Template and incorporate the questions and answers. If you have started to submit or have submitted your offer, you should receive an email notification stating that a new amendment has been issued. Please ensure you acknowledge receipt of all amendments, including Amendment 0002 and include this acknowledgment in your final offer. It has been brought to our attention that an issue has been identified where the amendment section does not display as expected when clicking the public posting link included with the notice on SAM.gov. The display issue affects how users access and view amendments after clicking the public posting link or the ability to download all attachments. In the interim, users are advised to perform a search using the solicitation number. The search can be done in the public portal (https://piee.eb.mil/sol/xhtml/unauth/index.xhtml) or the secure portal (registered users with an active Solicitation Module role can login into PIEE and click the Solicitation Module button).

Lastly, the PACTS III Team is no longer accepting questions pertaining to the PACTS III solicitations. 3/20/2024 - Update The PACTS III team is continuing to work through the questions submitted in response to the solicitations and will have them posted to sam.gov soon. The DHS will be issuing an Amendment 0002 to the solicitations which will incorporate the questions and responses as well as updates to the solicitations and a few attachments. Due to the unexpected delay in getting this information to the public, we do intend on extending the proposal response date which will be provided in the Amendment 0002 to the solicitations. 2/29/2024 The PACTS III team has received 500+ questions in response to the solicitations. Once we have answered all the questions, we will post them to sam.gov. Additionally, it has been brought to our attention that the amendment section of this posting is not displaying and it is making it difficult for the public to view Amendment 0001. The team is working hard to fix this issue; however, in the meantime, you can access the Amendment 0001 by clicking on the ""PIEE Solicitation Module Link for 70SBUR24R00000001"" and then ""Download All Attachments"" at the bottom of the screen. Contractors may also gain access to Amendment 0001 by logging into PIEE, searching the solicitation and scrolling to the bottom of the page. 2/13/2024 Amendment 0001 to 70SBUR24R0000001 has been issued to make changes to the Solicitation Cover Page, Part III, Request for Proposal Attachments, Part IV, Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 of the solicitation and the Offer Template in PIEE. The suite of Program Management, Administrative, Clerical, and Technical Services (PACTS) III Department-wide Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts are intended to provide program management, administrative, clerical, technical, and engineering commercial services and solutions that will enable the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to accomplish its mission objectives. The goals of PACTS III are to provide the Department and its Components a mechanism for quick ordering of professional services and solutions at fair and reasonable prices, to give qualified small businesses a greater opportunity to participate in these requirements, and to assist the Department with continuing to achieve and exceed its small business and socioeconomic goals. The Statement of Work (SOW), Attachment 1 which delineates the details of the services and solutions is composed of three comprehensive Functional Categories (FCs) of commercial services. The three FCs have a primary NAICS code that further describes the scope of work that will be procured under each FC. All three of the FCs have specific requirements that will be further identified and defined at the Task Order (TO) level). The FC and associated NAICS codes are as follows: FC1: Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services: NAICS Code: 541611; FC2: Office Administrative Services; NAICS Code: 561110; FC3: Engineering Services; NAICS Code: 541330. The DHS anticipates including four, separate and distinct tracks under each FC for the following socioeconomic groups: Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone) and 8(a) businesses. This solicitation, 70SBUR24R00000001, is for FC1: Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services: NAICS Code: 541611.

This system should have the required specifications (equal to or better than) what is listed below. This system and integrated hardware will support the evolving needs of IRS-CI special agents with the ability to inventory, document (with a narrative and photograph log), and collect/process evidence during enforcement operations at search warrant locations. This comprehensive system should include a deployable kit made up of handheld devices (Surface Pro tablets or Android platform cell phones) that agents will use to document evidence, take photos, and communicate with a centralized computing system/laptop through a closed, on-site network. The minimum requirements include, but are not limited to: Hardware Specific Requirements: Handheld, portable, devices that are capable of running a search warrant program, taking photos, and connecting to a closed network. Laptop (or equivalent equipment) capable of serving as the centralized point of communication for all the peripheral devices through the closed network. This device will need to compile data from all of the handheld devices and reconcile all entries into a consolidated program. Closed/Secure portable network (wifi router or equivalent). Printer and label makers. All devices will need to be able to be connected and communicate through a hardwired connection in the event of any potential network failure. All above items will need to be part of an easily deployable kit that includes approximately 10 handheld devices, one centralized computing device, a device capable of creating a closed, local network, a storage/transportation box, charging equipment, portable printer, and 10 label makers. Search Warrant Program Specific Requirements - The program will need to be able to: Be deployed on premises. No cloud solutions are sought at this time. Fully process a search warrant enforcement operation, to include, but not limited to the ability to log evidence seized, capture and assign entry/exit/evidentiary photos/videos, create/maintain a roster of operation participants, create/print labels, create/print a sketch of the premises, and create/print an inventory of all items seized at the search warrant location. Automatically combine and coordinate the data coming from the portable devices into one consolidated program/report. This data includes, but is not limited to, information identifying the names of the seizing agents, evidence description, and the location seized. Update all entries through the closed/local network with a backup option to update the centralized program through a wired connection if the network is not functioning properly. Import entries from an IRS-CI form (PDF) to ingest information into the program to eliminate duplicitous work efforts. Export information from the program into an IRS-CI form (PDF) at the conclusion of the enforcement operation. If needed, IRS-CI PDF forms can be made available upon request. Export a JSON file that is compatible with an internal IRS-CI electronic evidence inventory management system. Create inventory lists, operational information and other data from the program in files that can be transferred via USB and viewed outside of the program. Talk to text feature to provide agents the ability to capture narrative entries/descriptions. Flag important items for quicker review. Create and print evidence tag labels via a small label printer. Create, print and read Bar codes. Bar codes created would be used to log/identify multiple items of evidence within a box. Training and support. Transfer of data over LAN must be encrypted with minimum AES 256 standard. Respondents should have the ability to supply all the software, networking, and hardware requirements as outlined above in one comprehensive, integrated system. Please also review the attachements for more information."

The date of anticipated award will be announced once it is established. 8/27/2024 Update: Per the addendum to solicitation provision 52.212-1, paragraph 1.2, the Government anticipated awarding PACTS III in August 2024. The Government will not be awarding PACTS III in August 2024 and a new date of award has not yet been determined. Once the Government has a date it anticipates awarding PACTS III, we will post it on sam.gov. 5/29/2024 – Update: Questions 726-729 and the responses were inadvertently omitted from the list of Questions and Answers from Amendment 5 so they have been included and posted to sam.gov. These additional questions can be accessed by clicking on the attachment titled “PACTS III Solicitation Questions and Answers 05_21_24_Additional Questions” in the “Attachments/Links” section of this posting. These additional questions and responses will not be incorporated via an amendment. All proposals are due no later than May 31, 2024 by 5:00:00pm ET. 5/23/2024- Update: Amendment 0005 to 70SBUR24R00000003 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page and Part IV – Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation and to incorporate questions and answers. Offeror's must acknowledge all five amendments in order for its proposal to be acceptable. All amendments issued to the solicitations apply to all Offerors regardless if they are new or have provided a proposal already; therefore, all Offerors must acknowledge them in some way. If the Offeror is providing a new proposal or chooses to resubmit their proposal, per addendum to 52.212-1, para. 6.0 they are required to either check the box in PIEE that confirms the Offeror acknowledges all the amendments or they shall provide all the SF30s signed with their proposal in PIEE to reflect their acknowledgement. Per Amendments 0003-0005, if the Offeror chooses to keep the proposal it already submitted, it must send the signed SF 30s for each amendment to PACTSIII@uscis.dhs.gov no later than 5:00pm (5:00:00pm) ET on May 31, 2024. Additionally, the Offeror must state in its email that its original proposal or the one provided in response to Amendment 0003 (whichever one its validating) will remain valid from the time the email is sent to the period stated in its original Volume I cover sheet, Attachment 16. Acknowledging the amendments is the Offeror's admission that it understands the content of the amendments and that their proposal has taken the amendments into account and its proposal is in compliance with all the amendments. If the Offeror revalidated its original proposal by providing a signed SF30 via email in response to Amendment 0003, it only needs to send the SF30s for Amendment 0004 and 0005 via email if it chooses to continue to keep the proposal it originally submitted. Additionally, we recommend Offerors begin submitting their proposals sooner rather than later in PIEE. If Offerors have issues with PIEE, please call the PIEE help desk as soon as possible. Lastly, to gain access to the solicitation and all the amendments that have been issued, Contractors shall click on the “PIEE Solicitation Module Link for 70SBUR24R0000000X” below. This will take Contractors to the solicitation in PIEE. Once there, scroll to the bottom and each amendment will be at the bottom of the page. To access each amendment, click on the amendment number highlighted in blue. To locate the solicitation with the changes, Offerors must scroll to the bottom and click the attachments within the amendment. 5/21/2024 – Update: Amendment 0004 to 70SBUR24R00000003 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page, and Part IV – Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation (extended the proposal submission date). 5/20/2024 Update: Clarity is being provided as to what “if applicable” means in the addendum to 52.212-1, paragraph 4.3.1.2.2(f) in the statement “contract number and line item (if applicable)“. The intent of including “if applicable” after “contract number and line item” was meant to state, if the contract number and line item is available. To clarify this further, the DHS recognizes that including the contract number on a invoice and/or proof of payment may not be standard practice; therefore, the contract number may not be included on the invoice and/or proof of payment. If the contract number is missing from the invoice and/or proof of payment, the invoice and/or proof of payment will be acceptable forms of supporting documentation if the DHS is able to confirm the invoice and/or proof of payment provided is for the project/contract being claimed. 5/10/2024 Update Amendment 0003 to 70SBUR24R00000003 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page, Part II - Contract Clauses, Part III – Terms and Conditions and Attachments, and Part IV – Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation (extended the proposal submission date) 5/8/2024 Update: The DHS intends on amending this solicitation, no later than May 10, 2024, to include the following updates: The addendums to 52.212-1 and 52.212-2 will be updated to allow Offerors that have Non-Federal projects and projects performed as a First-Tier subcontractor to submit paid invoices as means to substantiate the obligated amounts claimed. The addendum to 52.212-1, paragraph 4.3.1.2.1(d)(ii) will be updated to clarify what it means when an Offeror includes the NAICS code/Product Service Code on the Project Verification Form. The addendums to 52.212-1 and 52.212-2 will be updated to clarify what “at the time of” means as it relates to an adequate accounting system and acceptable facility clearance. Minor administrative corrections As a result of these updates, Contractors may, but are not required to, submit a full proposal in response to the Amendment 0003 no later than 5pm (5:00:00 pm) ET on May 21, 2024.

All proposals are due no later than May 31, 2024 by 5:00:00pm ET. 5/23/2024 - Update: Amendment 0005 to 70SBUR24R00000002 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page and Part IV – Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation and to incorporate questions and answers. Offeror's must acknowledge all five amendments in order for its proposal to be acceptable. All amendments issued to the solicitations apply to all Offerors regardless if they are new or have provided a proposal already; therefore, all Offerors must acknowledge them in some way. If the Offeror is providing a new proposal or chooses to resubmit their proposal, per addendum to 52.212-1, para. 6.0 they are required to either check the box in PIEE that confirms the Offeror acknowledges all the amendments or they shall provide all the SF30s signed with their proposal in PIEE to reflect their acknowledgement. Per Amendments 0003-0005, if the Offeror chooses to keep the proposal it already submitted, it must send the signed SF 30s for each amendment to PACTSIII@uscis.dhs.gov no later than 5:00pm (5:00:00pm) ET on May 31, 2024. Additionally, the Offeror must state in its email that its original proposal or the one provided in response to Amendment 0003 (whichever one its validating) will remain valid from the time the email is sent to the period stated in its original Volume I cover sheet, Attachment 16. Acknowledging the amendments is the Offeror's admission that it understands the content of the amendments and that their proposal has taken the amendments into account and its proposal is in compliance with all the amendments. If the Offeror revalidated its original proposal by providing a signed SF30 via email in response to Amendment 0003, it only needs to send the SF30s for Amendment 0004 and 0005 via email if it chooses to continue to keep the proposal it originally submitted. Additionally, we recommend Offerors begin submitting their proposals sooner rather than later in PIEE. If Offerors have issues with PIEE, please call the PIEE help desk as soon as possible. Lastly, to gain access to the solicitation and all the amendments that have been issued, Contractors shall click on the “PIEE Solicitation Module Link for 70SBUR24R0000000X” below.

To locate the solicitation with the changes, Offerors must scroll to the bottom and click the attachments within the amendment. 5/21/2024 – Update: Amendment 0004 to 70SBUR24R00000002 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page, and Part IV – Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation (extended the proposal submission date). 5/20/2024 Update: Clarity is being provided as to what “if applicable” means in the addendum to 52.212-1, paragraph 4.3.1.2.2(f) in the statement “contract number and line item (if applicable)“. The intent of including “if applicable” after “contract number and line item” was meant to state, if the contract number and line item is available. To clarify this further, the DHS recognizes that including the contract number on a invoice and/or proof of payment may not be standard practice; therefore, the contract number may not be included on the invoice and/or proof of payment. If the contract number is missing from the invoice and/or proof of payment, the invoice and/or proof of payment will be acceptable forms of supporting documentation if the DHS is able to confirm the invoice and/or proof of payment provided is for the project/contract being claimed. 5/10/2024 Update: Amendment 0003 to 70SBUR24R00000002 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page, Part II - Contract Clauses, Part III – Terms and Conditions and Attachments, and Part IV – Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation (extended the proposal submission date) 5/8/2024 Update: The DHS intends on amending this solicitation, no later than May 10, 2024, to include the following updates: The addendums to 52.212-1 and 52.212-2 will be updated to allow Offerors that have Non-Federal projects and projects performed as a First-Tier subcontractor to submit paid invoices as means to substantiate the obligated amounts claimed. The addendum to 52.212-1, paragraph 4.3.1.2.1(d)(ii) will be updated to clarify what it means when an Offeror includes the NAICS code/Product Service Code on the Project Verification Form. The addendums to 52.212-1 and 52.212-2 will be updated to clarify what “at the time of” means as it relates to an adequate accounting system and acceptable facility clearance. Minor administrative corrections As a result of these updates, Contractors may, but are not required to, submit a full proposal in response to the Amendment 0003 no later than 5pm (5:00:00 pm) ET on May 21, 2024. If a contractor has already provided a proposal and it chooses to update/modify or add to their existing proposal, it must resubmit its proposal in PIEE in its entirety. However, if the Offeror chooses to keep the proposal it already submitted, it must send the signed SF 30 from Amendment 0003 to PACTSIII@uscis.dhs.gov no later than 5pm (5:00:00 pm) ET on May 21, 2024. Additionally, the Offeror must state in its email that its original proposal will remain valid from the time the email is sent to the period stated in its original Volume I cover sheet. If you did not submit a proposal or your proposal was provided after exactly 5:00pm (5:00:00 pm) Friday, April 12, 2024, you may submit a proposal no later than 5pm (5:00:00pm) ET on Tuesday, May 21, 2024. We highly recommend Offerors take this opportunity to review the proposals they submitted to ensure all required documents have been submitted and the Offeror used the Self-Scoring Sheet that corresponds to the Functional Category/ Solicitation the Offeror is proposing. If a Contractor chooses to submit a new or revised proposal, only include documents in the designated areas in the PIEE Offer Template. DO NOT include any documents in the catch-all “Attachments” area (after Volume IV) at the bottom of the template. Not abiding by this may result in a non-complaint proposal. Also, ensure you submit the correct versions of the Volume I Cover Sheet (Amendment 0001) and Project Cover Sheets (Amendments 0001 or 0002) when resubmitting. Lastly, please include a log of all changes/updates that were made between the original proposal submitted and the revised proposal in the “Proposal Table of Contents” folder in the PIEE template. If Contractors already provided a proposal and included documents in the “catch-all” or submitted the incorrect Volume I or Project Cover Sheets, they do not need to resubmit only to fix this error. However, if Contractors are providing new or revised proposals, we ask that they please abide by the instructions provided above. 4/12/2024 Update (Correction): There were errors made in the responses to questions 682, 692 and 696. Corrections to these questions have been made and are highlighted in red in the attached. 4/12/2024: Proposal are due no later than April 12, 2024 at 5pm ET as stated in Amendment 0002. A request for an extension will not be granted. Attached are our responses to some of the questions (675 – 700) that we have received. We are not incorporating these into an amendment since it would cause Offerors that have already submitted proposals in PIEE to completely redo their proposals. 4/9/2024: Proposal are due no later than April 12, 2024 at 5pm ET as stated in Amendment 0002. A request for an extension will not be granted. Attached are our responses to some of the questions (644 – 674) that we have received. We are not incorporating these into an amendment since it would cause Offerors that have already submitted proposals in PIEE to completely redo their proposals. Additionally, it is our understanding that when files are saved and uploaded into the PIEE system that the special characters associated with the naming conventions required in Attachment 9 may not appear. Please continue to abide by the naming conventions required in Attachment 9. If the special characters are replaced with “_” or are omitted when the files are saved or uploaded to PIEE, Offerors will not be deemed non-compliant. However, Offerors must continue to abide by the naming conventions required in Attachment 9 regardless of this issue. 3/28/2024 - Update Amendment 0002 to 70SBUR24R00000002 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page, Part II - Contract Clauses, Part III – Terms and Conditions and Attachments, and Part IV – Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation (extended the proposal submission date), update the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) Offer Template and incorporate the questions and answers. If you have started to submit or have submitted your offer, you should receive an email notification stating that a new amendment has been issued. Please ensure you acknowledge receipt of all amendments, including Amendment 0002 and include this acknowledgment in your final offer.

The display issue affects how users access and view amendments after clicking the public posting link or the ability to download all attachments. In the interim, users are advised to perform a search using the solicitation number. The search can be done in the public portal (https://piee.eb.mil/sol/xhtml/unauth/index.xhtml) or the secure portal (registered users with an active Solicitation Module role can login into PIEE and click the Solicitation Module button).

Lastly, the PACTS III Team is no longer accepting questions pertaining to the PACTS III solicitations. 3/20/2024 - Update The PACTS III team is continuing to work through the questions submitted in response to the solicitations and will have them posted to sam.gov soon. The DHS will be issuing an Amendment 0002 to the solicitations which will incorporate the questions and responses as well as updates to the solicitations and a few attachments. Due to the unexpected delay in getting this information to the public, we do intend on extending the proposal response date which will be provided in the Amendment 0002 to the solicitations. 2/29/2024 The PACTS III team has received 500+ questions in response to the solicitations. Once we have answered all the questions, we will post them to sam.gov. Additionally, it has been brought to our attention that the the amendment section of this posting is not displaying and it is making it difficult for the public to view Amendment 0001.

The Jacksonville District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be holding an Industry Day event regarding the design, fabrication, delivery, and installation of a fiber reinforced polymer sector gate at the Canaveral Lock in Brevard County, FL. The Government seeks feedback from engineers and fabricators with experience overseeing complex projects, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes. Seeking specific information, a list of questions will be uploaded to the SAM.gov website under the subject Notice ID. The Government is requesting answers to questions regarding design, fabrication, delivery, installation, site preparation for this supply item. Description of Project Project scope is to replace the existing steel sector gate with a FRP (composite) gate that will be mated/coupled to the existing steel hinge and pintle assemblies. Similar to all navigation gates half of the hinge and pintle assemblies are mounted to the existing concrete recesses at the lock wall and the other half of those steel assemblies are mounted to the gates. The new FRP gate will be fabricated and delivered completely assembled by a contractor under a supply contract. The hinge and pintle assemblies that will hold the FRP sector gate will be made of the same steel they will mate to on the lock wall. The original design and construction completed in the 1965-66 time frame and weigh 183 kips and included a barge impact load case of 120 kips. The new gates will consider room for inspection and maintenance, storm debris, sediment and marine life. New gates will need to support a Manatee detection and protection system; which is currently maintained by a contract so detections will likely remain very similar with protection similar but adapted to the new gate configuration. The contract drawings will show the details and size of the mounting plate for that system, which will be located close to the miter on the upstream and downstream sides of the gates. The Government maintenance crews will dewater the monolith that holds the existing steel gates, jack and remove the gates from the lock to install the new gates. The contractor technical (FRP) representative will be on site for the gate installation to advise on the fit and finish of the gate. The final acceptance will be met when the gate is fully mounted and able to swing without any issue. Some consideration for the new FRP gate are as follows: All future repairs of FRP will likely occur on site at the lock. FRP UV damage is typically mostly cosmetic and with integral UV inhibitors can be applied to manage aesthetics. Training will be necessary for inspection and repair of the new FRP. Consideration will need to be given for maintenance items with respect to pintle and hinge replacement items, such as bushings, pins, balls and grease lines, and painting of steels components. The Canaveral Lock helps reduce tidal velocities in the Canaveral Harbor, prevents hurricane tides into the Banana River and acts as a tidal salinity barrier. There are reverse flow that go through the gates. Specific Project Challenges For the Canaveral Lock sector gate, this is a large gate size with radial, pieshaped geometry. The proposed plan is to construct the gate out of FRP material, but some steel components will be included because of the ductile properties of steel. It is proposed to have the hinge and pintle assemblies made from steel, as well as the channel for the wire rope. The plans show the steel pintle and hinge assemblies with gussets plates attached to the gate. The design life is 100 yrs. but some components of the gate will have to be replaced. Those repairs will be in the field. This gate is to be part of the standardize of the USACE portfolio. Therefore, some of the wear and tear components need to be easily procured within the US. The Government would like to learn from industry how they would approach fabricating this type of gate. There is a lot of flexibility on how the framing structure of the gate is achieved. One limitation is allowing water to flow through the straight sides of the gate while the gate is moving. Those openings will need to be screened or grated to allow for water flow when opening and closing the gate, and to reduce the weight of the gate. It will need to be rigid enough to prevent manatees and other marine life from damaging it and gaining access within the gate. Environmental Conditions Manatee protection system is maintained by separate contractor. The function, installation, repair and removal will be done by that service contractor as required by the Government. NEPA coordination will be done for the Manatees. Manatee observers will be under contract to watch for manatee during the dewatering period. The coordination with the resource agency will be completed prior to dewatering the lock to remedy any potential issues with NEPA compliance. Location of Project The Canaveral Lock Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Sector gate replacement project is located at 1000 Mullet Road, Cape Canaveral, FL 32920 in Brevard County, FL.

This includes Sole Source limitations and limited competition scenarios. We limit competition through only soliciting a single source (sole source), soliciting to a small group of sources (generally based on market research), soliciting for a short period of time to such a degree that it would prevent some offerors from reasonably being able to provide an offer, or by making the requirements so restrictive that not all potential offerors would be able to compete. Any time we restrict competition to less than full and open (meaning that all companies that are interested would have a reasonable chance to provide an offer) we have a responsibility to justify that limitation. You cannot justify limiting competition on the basis of (6.301(c)) A lack of advance planning by the requiring activity Concerns related to the amount of funds available (e.g., funds will expire) to the agency or activity for the acquisition of supplies or services. We must still solicit offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances. Circumstances permitting other than full and open competition: Only One responsible source This means that this company is the only company in the entire world that can provide this service or supply NOT that is this the best of the bunch, NOT that you have already looked at the multiple options and determined this is the only one that you want. For a justification under this authority, we need the following to be included in the justification: What are the unique characteristics of the supply or service that result in this company being the only source? Why are these requirements necessary? What is the VA need being met here? If you are citing a need to match existing equipment, we need to know the age of the existing system, and its expected useful life. If the need is based in savings expected by not replacing an existing system, a cost benefit analysis is needed to show what the costs of a new system would be compared to the costs associated with replacing part of the system. This CBA must take into consideration the lifecycle costs (including replacement at the end of the useful life) of the existing system. We cannot just say that we avoid costs by keeping the current aged system, we must be able to describe the current condition of that system and what expected repair costs, if any, may be needed in the lifetime of the current purchase. We need to know when the system is expected to reach a point where it can be competitively replaced so that industry can know when we anticipate putting out a competitive requirement. If this is a service, we need to know why this company is the only one that can provide this service and how we know that. We cannot just take the company s word for it; we need to corroborate that with outside market research. The ultimate goal of a justification to limit competition based on only one responsible source is to explain to someone who has no experience with this item or service how we know this is the only offeror(s) that can provide what the Government needs. This includes describing what we need and why we need any salient characteristic that may limit the competition. Unusual and Compelling Urgency This authority is based on justifying that the Government s need is so important and so urgent that taking the time to provide for full and open competition would create great harm. This is generally defined as the possibility of loss of life, limb, or eyesight, or such grave financial damage to the Government that it is in the best interest of the Government and the taxpayer to limit competition. This must be an unusual circumstance (i.e. the end of a contract is not unusual). For this authority we need the following in the justification: Describe the unusual circumstance that makes the limitation of competition necessary. What are the ramifications if the Government does not act immediately to place this contract (e.g. significant patient harm, serious financial damage to the Government, etc.). What market research has been done, if any, to find the maximum number of sources possible? What is the Government s plan to avoid this type of situation in the future? How much time do we need to be able to address the situation or to compete a long-term solution? In the case of an unusual and compelling urgency, we cannot contract for more time than needed to compete a long-term need, and we cannot exceed 1 year (including any options). To use this authority we must show that the circumstances are both urgent and unusual that is, the urgency could not have been predicted. Industrial Mobilization The VA does not generally support these actions. The DoC will notify your station should this ever apply. International Agreement Does not affect the VA. Authorized by Statute This authority is used when another statute has provided grounds for the Agency to limit competition. The most prevalent examples of this for the VA are the laws surrounding prosthetic procurements and the Veterans First laws. Under these statues, while limitation of competition is allowed, full competition is still preferred. This authority is used at the discretion of the Contracting Officer and requires the following information in the justification: List the statutory authority that allows for the limitation of competition. A full explanation of the reason that using this statutory authority is in the best interests of the Government. A description of how the Government is working to limit the use of this limitation in the future (if applicable). National Security Not used by the VA. Public Interest Not used by the VA. ALL justifications should be written with the assumption that the person reading it has only a basic understanding of Government contracting rules and has no understanding of the underlying need. Justifications cannot make leaps in logic or assumptions about the market now or in the future. All justifications must be based on verified and verifiable facts. Remember that Competition is the preferred state for Government Acquisitions. To maximize that competition, the Agency must do a few things: Fairly and impartially describe the Government s need not desired bells and whistles, not favorite solution, not a copy and paste of a commercial product s characteristics. Create an Independent estimate of the appropriate cost/price for the items or services requested. Plan the procurement sufficiently in advance to allow time for competition (the FAR states that acquisition planning should take place in the FY prior to the year in which the Agency has the need) Best Practice Get ALL services that will be affected or involved in the procurement into the planning team as early as possible."

Background: The Department of the Air Force (DAF), Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Cyber and Networks Directorate (HN), Enterprise Information Technology and Cyber Infrastructure Division (HNI), Program Management Office (PMO) is seeking a vendor to act as a system integrator for current systems of record. The goal is to combine data sources into a unified view, incorporating Infrastructure, Network capability, and endpoint performance data into a single view. The primary change between the initial RFI (SAM.Gov Notice ID: UXM_RFI) and this revised RFI is the shift in focus from seeking a comprehensive monitoring solution to emphasizing system integration using existing pilot tools already deployed across the Department of the Air Force (DAF). The initial RFI aimed to gather information on solutions that provide real-time visibility into IT network, systems, and application performance, with capabilities such as service dependency mapping, network modeling, and application performance monitoring. In contrast, the revised RFI seeks a vendor to act as a system integrator to combine data sources into a unified view, incorporating infrastructure, network capability, and endpoint performance data. The goal is to enable real-time visibility and proactive issue resolution by integrating existing monitoring tools and systems to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the traffic and infrastructure within DAF networks. The UXM PMO is responsible for monitoring a complex network, systems, and application infrastructure that supports critical operations within the Department of the Air Force (DAF). This infrastructure includes base networking equipment, multiple data centers, cloud environments, VPNs, and a wide range of applications serving internal DAF users. The PMO is seeking a vendor to provide system integration services that can enable real-time visibility into the performance of the IT network, systems, and applications. The goal is to proactively identify and resolve issues by integrating existing monitoring tools and systems to achieve a comprehensive, holistic, and integrated understanding of the traffic and infrastructure within DAF networks. The system integrator deliverable should facilitate root-cause analysis, automated predictive problem detection, suggest solutions and fixes, and support planning and modeling for network improvements. Currently, network operators are using fragmented, piece-wise approaches to problem discovery and root cause analysis. We are looking for a system integrator who can improve problem-solving throughput and issue discovery by tracing problems from endpoints through the network to the underlying services, utilizing new and existing telemetry sources. The monitoring solution should include the ability to perform the following requirements: Service Dependency Mapping: Integrate tools to automatically map interdependencies between applications and alert on unexpected communication and bottlenecks. Network Modeling Capabilities: Integrate solutions to provide a dynamic network map, simulate network changes, compare configurations, support Distributed Tracing, and correlate with Network Events and Metrics from Logging. Application Performance Monitoring: Integrate tools for agent-based and synthetic testing for application performance monitoring, real-time transaction visibility, and user performance tracking. Customizable & Extensible: Support integration of tools for creating custom tests by non-expert programmers, ingesting and correlating data from other vendors, and integrating with existing DAF and DISA networking modeling investments. Standards: Ensure integration with industry standards supported, such as Export and Ingest of Open Telemetry data and compliance with Semantic Conventions for attributes. Accreditation and Approval: All integrated items must be Trade Agreements Act (TAA) compliant and approved for use within the Department of Defense (DoD). 2.

BACKGROUND The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Materials Measurement Laboratory, Materials Science and Engineering Division (https://www.nist.gov/mml/materials-science-and-engineering-division) is on the market for a video rate electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy. The simplest path to attain this capability is by upgrading the electronics and control system of our existing conventional electrochemical scanning tunneling microscope (ECSTM) that is presently limited to conventional slow scan rates, e.g. 36 lines per sec. The new system will intercept signals from our existing microscope and add fast x,y,z waveforms while simultaneously monitoring the response signal, such as the tunneling current, through a fast analog to digital converter. The advanced fast scan and video imaging capability are needed to study electrochemical deposition and etching processes relevant to the fabrication of advanced microelectronics chips and devices. Video rate ECSTM imaging will enable measurement of surfactant adsorbate dynamics that operate during electrochemical deposition of metals and to track how such adsorbates and their phase transitions influence morphological and microstructural evolution during metal deposition. The proposed research will help reveal how phenomena at atomistic and mesoscopic length scale impacts macroscopic outcomes. In addition to imaging the control system should off the option of having the ability to track the surface diffusion of individual molecules or adatom, a process known as atom tracking. Once integrated within our existing system the new controller and system should enable seamless transitions between slow scan imaging with our existing conventional scanner and the new high speed video rate scanning or atom tracking functions. The high-speed control system should have its own control algorithms and software to handle and process the substantial data flow associated with video rate imaging. Contract Line-Item Number (CLIN) 0001: The Contractor shall provide one (1) Control system and high voltage unit with software for control and data acquisition of video rate scanning probe microscopy. The system shall meet or exceed the technical specifications identified below. All items must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award. Experimental, prototype, or custom items will not be considered. The use of “gray market” components not authorized for sale in the U.S. by the Contractor is not acceptable. Dedicated controller for video rate scanning probe microscopy based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology and fast analog to digital (ADC) conversion. The control system should enable accelerated acquisition of atomic scale images and also offer as an option the ability to track the motion of features such as adatoms, vacancies and clusters across the surface, a process known as atom tracking. The implementation of fast probe motion control and signal acquisition need to be fully compatible and transparent with our existing PID STM controller control electronics (e.g. Molecular Imaging Pico Scan). No modification to the existing scanner hardware or electronics should be required for high-speed operation and its should be able to easily switch between the fast-scanning mode and the traditional slow imaging mode without any disruption. The system should intercept signals from our existing commercial SPM system and adds fast x, y, and z waveforms, while simultaneously acquiring the response signal (such as tunneling current, amplitude or phase) through a fast ADC. The system should be capable of imaging up to 200 x 200 pixels with a frame rate up to 100 Hz. The control unit ADC must sample at 100 MS/s with 16-bit resolution with an input range of at least ±1 V/±10 V and control unit fast output of 1.39 Ms/s at least 14-bit resolution ±10 V. The high-speed scanning voltage unit takes a ±10 V input with selectable gain to drive differential piezo output with max input and output voltages of ±200 V. Atom tracking involves two-dimensional feedback that allows local extremum (protrusion or depressions) on the imaged surface to followed with high temporal resolution. A computer, monitor, keyboard and mouse along with software to control video rate scanning and optional atom tracking operation. Installation and training shall be provided and one year warranty and service agreement. NIST conducted market research from August 2024 – November 2024 by, speaking with colleagues, performing internet searches, and speaking with vendors to determine what sources could meet NIST’s minimum requirements. The results of that market research revealed that only Caen Technologies, INC. (UEI: CGH1CSXQJ5H7) can meet all the Governments minimum requirements. Particularly, the combination of imaging up to 200 x 200 pixels with a frame rate up to 100 Hz. and a control unit with ADC samples at 100 MS/s with 16-bit resolution.

A decision-maker’s ability to synchronize military activities across five domains (i.e., air, land, maritime, space, and cyberspace), and adapt to rapidly changing threat landscapes hinges on robust mathematical frameworks and effective problem formulations that fully encapsulate the complexities of real-world operational environments. Unfortunately, mathematical approaches in Defense often rely on “good-enough” approximations, resulting in fragile solutions that severely limit our nation’s ability to address these evolving challenges in future conflicts. In contrast, establishing robust mathematical frameworks and properly formulating problems can yield profound and wide-reaching results. For instance, the Wiener filter1 was developed during World War II to help the U.S. military discern threats in the air domain from noisy radar observations. However, the technology’s effectiveness was limited due to its strong assumption of signal stationarity, a condition rarely satisfied in operational settings. By leveraging a dynamical systems approach, in 1960 Rudolf Kalman reformulated the filtering problem in a more robust state-space framework that inherently addressed non-stationarity.2 Sixty years later, the Kalman filter remains a pillar of modern control theory, supporting military decisions in autonomous navigation, flight control systems, sensor fusion, wireless communications and much more. The combination of a robust mathematical framework with the right problem formulation enables transformative Defense capabilities. Achieving this, however, requires deep mathematical insight to properly formulate the problem within the context of the specific Defense challenge at hand. To excel in increasingly complex, dynamic, and uncertain operational environments, military decision-makers need richer mathematical frameworks that fully capture the intricacies of these challenges. Emerging fields in mathematics offer the potential to provide these frameworks, but realizing their full potential requires innovative problem formulations. This ARC opportunity is soliciting ideas to explore the question: How can new mathematical frameworks enable paradigm shifting problem formulations that better characterize complex systems, stochastic processes, and random geometric structures?"

Answer: The transformer will be used to provide reduced power 24 hours a day. Question: The specifications provided appear inconsistent. We believe there may have been an error in specifying either the KVA or AMP requirement. Please clarify: A 25KVA transformer cannot support the listed amp draws. If the requirement is for 100 amps at 480 volts, this would equate to 200 amps at 208 volts, necessitating a 112KVA transformer. Conversely, a 25KVA transformer can only deliver 40 amps at 480 volts or 80 amps at 208 volts. Answer: The Government is leasing the mobile kitchen and has leased it on a prior occasion with a 25KVA transformer as recommended by the Mobile Kitchen owner. The Mobile Kitchen’s electrical requirements is 208VAC at 100 amps with all equipment running. During normal operation, all equipment in the kitchen is not utilized/energized at the same time. A 25KVA transformer has been previously utilized satisfactorily and was not overloaded because all of the Kitchen’s equipment was not utilized/running at the same time.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests and CC the Contracting Officer. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman at OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer’s name, solicitation closing date (if applicable), and their concerns. Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program, and CC the Contracting Officer in all communications. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be emailed to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer. Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed."

North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code: 541620 Small Business Size Standard: $19M Solicitation: The NPS anticipates issuing a solicitation approximately March of 2025. Project Description: The Geologic Resources Division (GRD), National Park Service (NPS), in Lakewood, Colorado, manages the Service wide Abandoned Mineral Land (AML) Program. Past mineral development has left more than 3,400 AML sites with approximately 39,000 individual mined features or orphaned oil and gas wells in 150 units of the National Park System. Some of these features have public safety or environmental impacts. Many AML sites also have cultural values and provide important wildlife habitat. The GRD AML Program seeks to identify, assess, and mitigate human safety hazards and ecological impacts at sites and features that require remedial action while also protecting natural and cultural resources, wildlife habitat, and opportunities for visitor education and enjoyment. The inventory, assessment, reclamation, closure, and safety actions taken at each AML feature require specific environmental, mine engineering, resource, and construction project expertise. Specific AML program needs include inventories, assessment, research, compliance documentation, project planning, reclamation, safety, training, outreach, and closure expertise, as well as project management. Mining Engineer: The process of reclaiming, closing, or improving the safety at AML sites requires expertise and experience in geology, mining, natural resources, cultural resources, engineering, and NPS management objectives. GRD requires the planning, implementation, and oversight of AML reclamation, closure, and/or mitigation projects; monitoring of project effectiveness; management of multiple mitigation and reclamation projects at one time; and conducting of AML site and feature inventories, site investigations and evaluations, and surveys. Natural/Cultural Resources Specialist: The compliance needed at AML sites includes the evaluation, consultation, and documentation required by laws such as the National Park Service Organic Act, Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, the Wilderness Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and park enabling statutes; Executive Orders; tribal consultation requirements; safety requirements; and applicable permitting requirements (such as the minimum tool analysis under the Wilderness Act). Project Manager: The Project Manager will work with the AML Coordinator to provide leadership, direction and guidance on over 100 park projects worth over $50M focusing on protection and restoration of natural and cultural resources from impacts of abandoned mining, oil, and gas legacy work. Submittal Contents: Interested (small and large) businesses should submit the following information: 1) Company name: a. UEI number b. Address c. Point of contact d. Telephone number e.

SCOPE 1.1 The material covered in this contract/purchase order will be used in a crucial shipboard system. The use of incorrect or defective material would create a high probability of failure resulting in serious personnel injury, loss of life, loss of vital shipboard systems, or loss of the ship itself. Therefore, the material has been designated as SPECIAL EMPHASIS material (Level I, Scope of Certification, or Quality Assured) and special control procedures are invoked to ensure receipt of correct material. 2. APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 2.1 Order of Precedence - In the event of a conflict between the text of this contract/purchase order and the references and/or drawings cited herein, the text of this contract/purchase order must take precedence. Nothing in this contract/purchase order, however, must supersede applicable laws and regulations unless a specific exemption has been obtained. 2.2 Applicable Documents - The document(s) listed below form a part of this contract/purchase order including modifications or exclusions. 2.2.1 Specification Revisions - The specification revisions listed under ""Documents References"" below are the preferred revision. Older and/or newer r evisions are acceptable when listed within Contract Support Library Reference Number CSD155 in ECDS (Electric Contractor Data Submission) at: ht tps://register.nslc.navy.mil/. This is to allow Contractors to use certain acceptable older specification revisions to purge their existing stock of material certified to those older revisions or to use newer specification revisions when material is certified to newly released revisions,without requiring the submittal of waiver/deviation requests for each specification revision on every contract. Revisions of specifications reflecting editorial and/or re-approval (e.g. E2009, R2014, etc.) are considered inconsequential, but are acceptable when their revisions are listedwithin CSD155 or elsewhere within this contract. 2.2.2 ""Document References"" listed below must be obtained by the Contractor.

The WWAO’s mission is to support advances in water management in the western U.S. using NASA data, technology, and tools in partnership with water managers and decision makers. In 2023, the WWAO conducted a Needs Assessment for the Missouri River Basin that identified high priority data gaps and information needs for water resources management in the Basin, the report dated 7/18/2023 is attached as Exhibit 1. This assessment highlighted 21 specific data needs and associated use cases related to watershed health and management, water availability, water quality, agriculture and irrigation, and water infrastructure. Many water managers recognize the value of NASA’s remote-sensing research and data for decision support, but they also find it challenging to use for decision-making. In many cases, water management offices/agencies may lack the scientific and technical resources to access, process, or analyze the information for decision-making. The WWAO seeks to bridge this gap by developing needs-driven solutions. 2.0 Scope Through this RFI, the WWAO is seeking descriptions of current or planned activities to develop or deploy tools and services that use NASA data and technologies that could address the specific data gaps and high-priority information needs identified in the 2023 WWAO Missouri River Basin Needs Assessment Report (Exhibit 1). Examples of concepts that are a priority for the RFI include: management and forecasting of water supply, monitoring and managing water use especially as it relates to agricultural use, infrastructure including assessment of conditions, understanding water quality and watershed health especially as it relates to algal blooms, temperature changes, and riparian and wetland habitats. The activities described in each RFI response should address a water-resource management challenge and may range from local management for individual fields, to regional scales of municipalities and districts, to basin-wide efforts. The activities described may include, but are not limited to: 2.1 Workshops and meetings to develop partnerships, refine remote sensing application concepts and user requirements and development/evaluate early prototypes. 2.2 Applied research to quantify the uncertainty of remote sensing derived data products specifically for the Missouri River Basin to verify that new data products meet partner specifications and requirements. 2.3 Applied research and software engineering to advance the Applications Readiness Level (ARL) (reference Exhibit 2) of a NASA information product, technology, or tool that supports water-resource management in the Missouri River Basin. 2.4 Integration of a remote sensing variable(s) into an existing Missouri River Basin water management decision support tool or workflow. 2.5 Focused workshop(s), outreach and/or capacity building activities to advance information products or technologies to sustained use by water resources decision makers in the Missouri River Basin. 2.6 Existing or proposed collaborations with NASA researchers to facilitate the use of NASA data in water management operations. Responses that reach underserved groups through a combination of outreach and technical assistance to address local issues are encouraged. Responses that include a water-resource management partner are strongly encouraged. 3.0 Requirements for Responses Responses to this RFI should describe a concept that is currently at an ARL of 3 or higher and a scope of work that would advance a solution by at least one ARL. Responses should be no longer than 4 pages (excluding references and letters of support) and should include the following (each section starts with the page limit on the corresponding response): 3.1 (0.25 page) A description of the water resources management need and information gap that clearly references high priority needs described in the WWAO Missouri River Basin Needs Assessment Report (Exhibit 1) and a concept that applies NASA remote sensing data and technology to address the need. 3.2 (1 page) A summary of the scientific/technical basis for the application concept that includes: the water management information or data need to be addressed, the NASA data or technology that will be used in the solution, the role and responsibilities of the water-resource management partner in the Missouri River Basin, the role of the water-resource management partner in the proposed project, and, the water-resource management decision that is targeted by the concept, a description of the current ARL Level, the expected ending ARL, and any past studies to quantify the accuracy of the results. 3.3 (0.5 page) An explanation of how the concept addresses a need identified in the WWAO Missouri River Basin Needs Assessment Report (Exhibit 1). 3.4 (0.25 page) A description of past partnering activities, the role of the partner agency, and the significance and impact of the past work. 3.5 (0.25 page) A description of expertise using NASA data and/or technology that clearly articulates experience working with NASA data. Responses that include experience with multiple and/or emerging NASA data or technologies are encouraged. 3.6 (0.25 page) A description of how the concept will impact water management if the need is met. 3.7 (0.25 page) A high-level workplan and schedule, listing key milestones and deliverables. 3.8 (0.25 page) A high-level budget summary and description of contribution by the water-management partner. 3.9 (1 page) Relevant experience. 3.10 (not counted against page limit) State if your organization is a small business: <1000 employees; NAICS code 541715 Environmental research and development laboratories or services (except biotechnology and nanotechnology research and development). 3.11 (not counted against page limit) Include one or more letters of support from the water-resource management partner entity that includes a description of expected benefits for the water management organization. 3.12 (not counted against page limit) References if applicable. 4.0 RFI Exhibits Exhibit 1 – WWAO Missouri River Basin Needs Assessment Report, dated July 18, 2023. Total pages: 45 including cover. Exhibit 2 – The Application Readiness Level Metric, dated July 3, 2024. Total pages: 12 including cover. All RFI’s will be reviewed by the WWAO Program Management Organization and the Acquisition Organization to determine the activities that are highly aligned with the programmatic objectives described in this RFI. These RFI responses could lead to Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and eventually to subcontracts in the range of $100-200K total, with a period of performance of up to 24 months. Should a response move forward to an RFP, it must be co-developed with a water-resource management partner. If a respondent does not have a partner, the WWAO may form teams to ensure co-development of proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and description for the anticipated subcontract efforts is 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology). The size standard for this NAICS code is 1,000 employees. Additional information can be found here: https://www.sba.gov/document/support-table-size-standards. The requested information is for preliminary planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment implied or otherwise, that JPL will solicit you for such procurement in the future. Neither JPL nor the Government will be responsible for any costs incurred by you in furnishing this information. All RFI respondents are advised that any information provided shall be deemed to be furnished with unlimited rights to JPL with JPL assuming no liability for the disclosure, use or reproduction of such data.

The sand would be dredged from the Inlet and subsequently placed along the Far Rockaway, NY Beach shoreline per the plans and specifications. The proposed maintenance dredging would remove approximately 450,000 cubic yards of sand from the East Rockaway Inlet and Deposition Basins. Dredging would be required to a depth of -14 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 2 feet allowable over-depth. The dredged material is greater than 90% sand. The proposed work is anticipated to be performed by utilizing a hydraulic dredge. Additionally, barges, tugboats, pipeline and land-based equipment such as dozers, will be needed to perform the work during the dredging and placement activities. The dredging and placement along the shoreline would be required to meet all federal, state, and local criteria required by the government agencies having jurisdiction where the dredging and placement sites are located. Once the contract is awarded, the contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him of the notice to proceed and maintain an integrated production rate of at least 12,000 cubic yards per calendar day for the dredging and placement of the dredged sand. The presence of dredging equipment in the channel will impact ship traffic, and it is necessary to maintain this production rate while minimizing the duration of this impact. The proposed work is anticipated to take place in the fall/winter of 2025/2026. The project magnitude is estimated between $10,000,000.00 and $15,000,000.00.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Design, Manufacture, and Performance - Except as modified herein, the CASE,AFTERBODY TORP furnished under this contract/purchase order shall meet the design, manufacture, and performance requirements specified on drawing ;7052969; cage ;53711; . 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled ""Configuration Management"", Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated. The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D. Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E. Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E. (Original and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.3.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5. PACKAGING 5.1 Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking - Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking shall be in accordance with the Contract/Purchase Order Schedule and as specified below.

The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) currently deploys several communications capabilities in response to declared emergencies. Many of FEMA’s currently utilized communication solutions are centered around traditional methods. Geostationary satellite systems have been deployed, but introduce correspondingly long latencies. Additionally, provisioning of a router and circuit to disaster sites can take days to weeks.?For the last few years FEMA has deployed a FIPS compliant cellular solution which utilizes an array of high-gain antennae, however, these devices are reliant on terrestrial communication with cell towers, which can be compromised or unavailable in disaster areas due to the nature of the disaster.? LEO satellite communications will fill in the gap by providing consistent high-speed internet connectivity that is less likely to be impacted by weather, terrain, and disasters. One of our programs currently utilizes Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Starlink terminals. This is a market research tool being used to determine the availability of Low Earth Orbit technologies that can provide these capabilities and services.

The statutory authority for this acquisition is 41 USC 3304(a)(1); FAR 13.106-1(b). ***** Sole source determination is based on the need to acquire a quantity of one (1) 300 mm Si wafer with Cu damascene patterns to advance the CHIPS mission of developing imaging and measurement solutions for integrated circuit (IC) overlay metrology using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Minimum Requirements: Description: 300 mm Si wafer with Cu damascene patterns Quantity: 1 For the SEM overlay metrology project, NIST requires a 300 mm Si wafer sample of a set of chips with Cu damascene patterns suitable for research and development efforts to evaluate the feasibility of physics-based simulations and AI-based modeling as the means to improve the performance of SEM-based overlay metrology. 193 nm lithography shall be used to create the overlay metrology patterns. It is also advantageous, but not required to place other than overlay dimensional metrology patterns on the chips. All chips across the wafer shall be made identical, naturally occurring small variations due to fabrication processes are permitted. Specifically, the Contractor shall provide one wafer containing at least 12 chips with the following overlay metrology parameters: 1. Cu damascene patterns with box-in-box (BiB), image-based overlay (IBO), advanced imaging metrology (AIM) grating patterns, and Hitachi-type SEM-based overlay (SBO). Pattern design can be found in pertinent public literature. 2. Sets of varying size BiB, IBO, AIM and SBO overlay metrology patterns must be included in the less than 150 mm to smaller than 50 mm range. 3. Overlay patterns with intentional, small, close to 1, 2, 5, and 10 nm variations of known overlay offsets (shifts) must be provided. 4. The wafer must be covered with a protective layer to safeguard the integrity of the Cu patterns. 5. A GDSII-based map with pattern locations and properties (size, type, offset, etc.) identification must be provided. 6. Documentation about the wafer material, dopant type and concentration, and the patterning process shall be provided. Market Research was conducted in October and November of 2024, including internet searches, searches of GSA and Thomas Register, speaking with professional contacts, and reviewing company websites. Internet searches using google.com revealed several companies that are capable of manufacturing the required wafer, however they would require a photomask to manufacture the required wafer. Obtaining a photomask would require significant additional time and cost to obtain, making these options cost-prohibitive in this instance. Additionally, these companies will only manufacture the required wafers with a minimum order greater than one (1). Many other commercial wafer manufacturers sell wafers with no required patterns on them, and do not meet NIST's requirements for a Cu patterned wafer. AMAG Consulting is the only company that can make the required wafer, without a photomask, in the required quantity. This market research determined that AMAG Consulting is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the equipment that meets the required minimum specifications. *****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334416 – Semiconductor and Related Device Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 1,250 employees. *****A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. *****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Interested parties that believe they can satisfy the requirements listed above must identify their capability in writing before the response date of this notice. Only responses received by 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on January 29, 2025 will be considered by the government.

Provide the available capacity of key disciplines by providing current project workload, inclusive of all projects awarded by the VA during the previous twelve (12) months and the full potential value of any current indefinite delivery con-tracts. Offeror shall clearly state their available capacity presenting workload percent-ages for the key disciplines and/or team members. Also, the offeror must provide the completion percentages and expected completion date for the VA projects awarded in the previous twelve (12) months. The information for this factor shall be provided in Section H of the SF 330. Please ensure the capacity applies toward the team/personnel provided in the SF 330. Past performance (section H): Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Past performance will be evaluated for all projects provided in Section F. The Contractor Performance Assessment Rating System (CPARS) database will be reviewed to evaluate the projects that have a CPARS entry. CPARS are not required to be submitted with the SF330 submission. The contract number for the project must be submitted with each project in Section F so CPARS can be reviewed in the database. Please note we are unable to review any CPARS from other Federal Agencies, outside of the VA. For any project that does NOT have CPARS data available, a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) is required to be submitted with the SF330. The PPQ should be rated and signed by the evaluator. In the event that a firm does not receive a requested complete PPQ from an evaluator prior to the time for submission, the firm shall submit the partially completed PPQ with Section 1 and the Evaluator Information in Section 2 completed. Ensure a POC is listed with the project title/contract number. The VA will make reasonable attempts to contact the POC upon submission for PPQ completion. Evaluations may also include additional performance related from the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, publicly available sources, and additional projects in CPARS. The Government reserves the right to contact any POC listed on a CPARS report or PPQ. Evaluations will consider superior performance ratings on recently completed VA projects as well as the reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness. If appropriate, the record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services may be evaluated. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed by the office/branch/individual team member performing the work under this contract. The information for this factor shall be provided in Section H of the SF 330. For PPQs, please utilize the attached PPQ document. Completed PPQs should be incorporated into the SF 330 directly. PPQs should not be submitted to the VHA PCAC directly. Any PPQs will not be counted towards the page limitations for this submission. However, any narratives provided for past performance in Section H will be counted toward the page limit. Knowledge of Locality (section H): to include specific knowledge of certain local conditions or project site features, such as geological features, climatic conditions, working with and local construction methods or local laws and regulations. The information for this factor shall be provided in Section H of the SF 330. Note that the intent of this factor is to showcase a firm s understanding of the site and locality, and not where the firm is located and how they would travel to the site. Information related to the firm s location, shall be provided in section H, under Secondary Selection Criteria Factor 1. Experience in construction period services (Section H): Experience in construction period services must be demonstrated via project experience. These may be the same projects identified above in Factor 1; however, the firm shall clearly delineate the types of construction period services performed for each. Project descriptions must include experience with: Solicitation support services, Professional field inspections during the construction period, Review of construction submittals, Support in answering requests for information during the construction period, Support of construction contract changes to include drafting statements of work and cost estimates, Attendance at weekly conference calls, providing minutes of meetings between the AE, VA, and contractors, Pre-final inspection site visits, Generation of punch-list reports, Coordination with commissioning requirements and Production of as-built documentation. In addition, the firm must include experience addressing unforeseen conditions and emergent situations, conducting situation evaluations and make midcourse corrections. Include description on how the firm can be proactive or responsive in these situations. The firm shall provide a detailed description of projects worked that illustrate experience in these ten areas. Projects must be within the last ten (10) years. The information for this factor shall be provided in Section H of the SF 330. Secondary Selection Criteria: Geographic Location - Location of the firm, as measured by the driving distance (miles) between the Offeror s principal business location and: Sam Rayburn Memorial Veteran Center 1201 E. 9th Street Bonham, Texas 75418. Determination of the mileage will be based on Google Maps (https://www.google.com/maps/dir/). The secondary selection criterion is used as a tiebreaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms following the completion of the SF330 evaluations. The secondary selection criterion will not be applied when determining a firm s SF330 submission Excellent, Good, Acceptable, Marginal, or Unacceptable. The information for this factor shall be provided in Section H of the SF330. 6.

ZONE 1 NORTH DAKOTA Customers Dakota Dining Minot AFB, Minot ND 58704 5th Missile Feeding Minot, Minot, ND 58705 Airey Dining Grand Forks AF, Grand Forks, ND 58205 119th ANG Flight Wing, Fargo, ND 58102 CDC grand forks AFB ND, GRAND FORKS AFB, ND 58205 Youth center program grand forks,GRAND FORKS AFB ND 58205 Food service staff office ZONE 2 SOUTH DAKOTA Customers 114th ANG - Joe Foss Field, Sioux Falls, SD 57104 Ellsworth Raiders Café, Ellsworth, AFB, SD 57706 Pine Ridge I H S Hospital, Pine Ridge, SD 57770-1201 Camp Rapids SD, Rapid City, SD 57703 Following are specific questions to consider: 1. Please provide the name of your Company and point of contact information. If your company has a Cage Code, please provide that as well. 2. In what type of business is your company involved – e.g. logistics, food distribution? Who are your firm’s major customers, e.g. retailers, industrial accounts, commercial accounts? 3. Is your firm considered a large or small business concern? Small business is generally defined as a firm that employs less than 700 employees. 4. Do you believe your firm can successfully perform the requirements discussed above in the third paragraph of this RFI? If so, please explain why. If not, please explain why. 5. Can you support any or all the customers, in both North Dakota and South Dakota, as listed above? If you cannot support any or all the customers described above, please provide the reason why you cannot provide support. Many of the customers expect delivery 48 hours after placing their orders. Are there any location limitations in meeting this delivery schedule? 6.Historically, SPV contracts for land customers located in North and South Dakota had contract terms of 5 years and sales in these regions have been estimated around $1,247,998.16 per year for North Dakota and $914,564.79 per year for South Dakota. Can your firm manage this volume? What is the revenue generated from product moving through your warehouse(s) on an annual basis? Is revenue generated from any other source associated with the aforementioned warehouse? If so, explain? 7. Does your firm have a warehouse in North Dakota and/or South Dakota? If not, does your firm have the capabilities to obtain a warehouse in North Dakota and/or South Dakota? Do you feel it be more feasible to establish more than one warehouse in North Dakota and/or South Dakota to meet customer requirements? Identify any constraints that may prevent your firm from developing warehouse platforms in North Dakota and/or South Dakota. 8.Do you have preferred delivery set-ups (routes, grouping of customers) to provide complete food support throughout North and South Dakota? 9.Some of our customers are remotely located and require smaller pack-size items. Can this requirement be provided? Can you provide service to them, regardless of weather conditions? What method of shipping would be used? 10.The terms of the Berry Amendment, 10 U.S.C. 4862, will likely apply to items under any solicitation that is issued and the resulting contract. In general, items that are subject to the Berry Amendment must be grown, reprocessed, or produced in the United States or its possessions, see DFARS Clause 252.225-7012. Can you provide Berry Amendment compliant/United States domestic products? 11. A Surge Requirement is one that could increase the normal orders by 300% in which you would be required to satisfy requirements for emergency situations (i.e., ramp up to meet early requirements (surge) and/or requirements that may exceed estimated annual quantities). DLA defines surge as the ability to ramp up quickly to meet early requirements normally needed within the first 30 days of a contingency. Sustainment is defined as the ability to sustain an increased pace throughout the contingency(s) for six months or longer. A surge situation is defined as an increase in military feeding of 300% of peacetime demand for a period of up to 30 days. How would you be able to accommodate this increase? What would be the time frame needed to attain these increased quantities? Will your company be able to operate at the increased output of products for a period of six months or longer? If not, what are some of the reasons why you would not be able to operate at this elevated demand and not meet the surge requirement? 12. Would there be customers who could not be supported if an emergency order is needed (either same day or next day)? 13. Please confirm if your facility is capable and willing to complete a long-term 5-year contract. We encourage and appreciate your participation; please share your ideas regarding these issues. Your written comments, suggestions and ideas regarding support for our customers will be treated as confidential and for Government use only. Please provide your responses via email, by January 29th, 2025 at 12:00 p.m. Philadelphia Local Time to the following email addresses: Neil-Michael Chiaradio at neil.michael.chiaradio@dla.mil and Tania Mboge at Tania.Mboge@dla.mil"

Any questions received and subsequent answers will be posted to https://sam.gov/ for the benefit of all interested parties. 3. An itemized budgetary estimate for a system capable of satisfying the SOURCES SOUGHT’s Required Capabilities. Itemized estimates are preferred should DMA need to adjust system specifications. Purpose: This SOURCES SOUGHT outlines the requirement for upgrading our studio sets and lighting systems to enhance production capabilities. The scope includes the consultation, design, engineering, furnishing, installation, testing, and commissioning of advanced studio hardware, lighting systems, and supporting software. Additionally, the effort will encompass the provision of training, documentation, and ancillary equipment to ensure seamless integration and operation. The upgraded solution should deliver state-of-the-art lighting control, improved visual production quality, and optimized system functionality to support our evolving broadcast and production needs. Scope: Our studios have been essential workhorses, serving as the backbone for much of the content produced in our building. While they remain functional, they are showing their age and require a significant refresh to align with current industry standards and meet our operational demands. These spaces are heavily utilized, especially during peak periods, making modernization crucial for sustaining our high production standards. The Studio Refresh Project is a key step toward achieving DMA’s strategic priority to “Develop a workplace of the future.” To maintain our position as the premier provider of communications services within the Department of Defense, we must modernize our technology and infrastructure. Recent advancements, including the acquisition of new cameras and updates to our production switchers, have improved our capabilities, but the sets and lighting in our studios—nearly 15 years old are overdue for an upgrade. This project reflects our commitment to innovation and delivering exceptional support to our customers. Currently, the sets in Studios one and two feature outdated printed backgrounds that no longer represent our mission or modern aesthetics, while the lighting systems rely on aging technology. . These older systems consume more power, generate excessive heat, and present challenges in sourcing replacement bulbs, many of which are now obsolete. Transitioning to LED lighting technology will not only improve efficiency and reduce operational costs but also support the Department of Defense’s “Go Green” initiative through reduced energy consumption. The monitors and screens in our studios are also outdated and don’t provide the quality we need for broadcast productions. The scope of this project includes evaluating and updating the sets in Studios One and Two and replacing the lighting systems in all four studios. This includes assessing the current studio spaces to ensure they align with operational requirements and future needs. A phased implementation approach is being considered, allowing ongoing production to continue in one studio while upgrades are completed in another. Our initial focus will be on modernizing the sets and lighting in Studios One and Two, setting the foundation for a studio environment that reflects the cutting edge of broadcast production and ensures our continued excellence in service delivery. Our sets are used to support all of the Service (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and the Secretary of Defense) Production houses as well as a plethora of external clients. We are looking for solutions that will allow us to be agile and adaptive in providing productions and capabilities well into the future. The Contractor shall furnish all necessary personnel, materials, services (except as otherwise specified herein), and otherwise perform all tasks necessary for or incident to the requirements as set forth below: The Contractor shall provide a comprehensive solution for the studio set and lighting refresh, delivering state-of-the-art systems to enhance production quality and operational efficiency. The scope includes the design, fabrication, engineering, furnishing, installation, and commissioning of new studio sets and advanced lighting systems for two primary studios, with compatibility and integration into existing infrastructure. The solution for lighting must feature modern, energy-efficient LED technology, compatible with existing power and control systems, and capable of supporting a dynamic, flexible production environment. The lighting system must include seamless dimming and color-temperature adjustments to optimize visual output and meet contemporary broadcast standards while aligning with the Department of Defense's ""Go Green"" initiative. For the studio sets, the design must incorporate modular and visually striking elements that align with the organization’s branding and allow for future scalability. The sets should be versatile, enabling quick reconfigurations to support varied content production requirements. We require the ability to continue large scale town hall type events with Studio audiences, interview panels and a variety of other configurations. Integration with the existing ROSS Television Switcher and Router system, ETC Sensor+ Dimmer System, and the AES67 Audio over IP Routing System (Wheatstone technology) is essential to ensure seamless operation. The solution must also include failover redundancy for all critical components, ensuring uninterrupted production during potential equipment failures. The Contractor will deliver a phased implementation plan to maintain studio operations while upgrades are performed sequentially in each space. This approach ensures continuity of service while achieving the modernization objectives of the studio refresh project. This project will use existing space and there is no expectation or requirement for new construction.

This is not a solicitation for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. This RFI does not constitute a commitment from the Government and any information provided in response to this RFI will be used for informational purposes only. Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked. Vendor participation is not a promise for future business with the Government. The purpose of this RFI is to conduct Market Research. Background: DLA Troop Support expects to issue the solicitation for Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) supporting the North and South Dakota Regions within the Contiguous United States (CONUS). DLA Troop Support’s CONUS SPV contractors are responsible for providing full-line food and beverage item distribution support for garrison type feeding to military, federally funded, and other authorized customers in the regions covered by each contract. The DLA Troop Support SPV contractor will be responsible for providing food products such as canned items, dry items, chill items, ultra-high temperature (UHT) dairy items, frozen bakery products, frozen meats, frozen seafood and poultry, ice cream, eggs, and other dairy products under this contract. Information on the current DLA Troop Support CONUS SPV contracts can be found at http://www.dla.mil/TroopSupport/Subsistence/Foodservices/Regions/CONUS.aspx. Subsistence Prime Vendor support includes but is not limited to: sourcing food items; receiving and consolidating product; warehousing and inventory management; quality control, quality assurance, and inspections; transportation, personnel management, meeting required delivery dates, and extensive reporting requirements. DLA Troop Support's CONUS Subsistence Prime Vendor (CONUS SPV) Program is interested in your comments regarding food support for our current customers listed below in the North and South Dakota region.

If your company has a Cage Code, please provide that as well. In what type of business is your company involved – e.g. logistics, food distribution? Who are your firm’s major customers, e.g. retailers, industrial accounts, commercial accounts? Is your firm considered a large or small business concern? Small business is generally defined as a firm that employs less than 700 employees. Do you believe your firm can successfully perform the requirements discussed above in the third paragraph of this RFI? If so, please explain why. If not, please explain why. Can you support any or all the customers, in both North Dakota and South Dakota, as listed above? If you cannot support any or all the customers described above, please provide the reason why you cannot provide support. Many of the customers expect delivery 48 hours after placing their orders. Are there any location limitations in meeting this delivery schedule? Historically, SPV contracts for land customers located in North and South Dakota had contract terms of 5 years and sales in these regions have been estimated around $1,247,998.16 per year for North Dakota and $914,564.79 per year for South Dakota. Can your firm manage this volume? What is the revenue generated from product moving through your warehouse(s) on an annual basis? Is revenue generated from any other source associated with the aforementioned warehouse? If so, explain? Does your firm have a warehouse in North Dakota and/or South Dakota? If not, does your firm have the capabilities to obtain a warehouse in North Dakota and/or South Dakota? Do you feel it be more feasible to establish more than one warehouse in North Dakota and/or South Dakota to meet customer requirements? Identify any constraints that may prevent your firm from developing warehouse platforms in North Dakota and/or South Dakota. Do you have preferred delivery set-ups (routes, grouping of customers) to provide complete food support throughout North and South Dakota? Some of our customers are remotely located and require smaller pack-size items. Can this requirement be provided? Can you provide service to them, regardless of weather conditions? What method of shipping would be used? The terms of the Berry Amendment, 10 U.S.C. 4862, will likely apply to items under any solicitation that is issued and the resulting contract. In general, items that are subject to the Berry Amendment must be grown, reprocessed, or produced in the United States or its possessions, see DFARS Clause 252.225-7012. Can you provide Berry Amendment compliant/United States domestic products? A Surge Requirement is one that could increase the normal orders by 300% in which you would be required to satisfy requirements for emergency situations (i.e., ramp up to meet early requirements (surge) and/or requirements that may exceed estimated annual quantities). DLA defines surge as the ability to ramp up quickly to meet early requirements normally needed within the first 30 days of a contingency. Sustainment is defined as the ability to sustain an increased pace throughout the contingency(s) for six months or longer. A surge situation is defined as an increase in military feeding of 300% of peacetime demand for a period of up to 30 days. How would you be able to accommodate this increase? What would be the time frame needed to attain these increased quantities? Will your company be able to operate at the increased output of products for a period of six months or longer? If not, what are some of the reasons why you would not be able to operate at this elevated demand and not meet the surge requirement? Would there be customers who could not be supported if an emergency order is needed (either same day or next day)? Please confirm if your facility is capable and willing to complete a long-term 5-year contract. We encourage and appreciate your participation; please share your ideas regarding these issues. Your written comments, suggestions and ideas regarding support for our customers will be treated as confidential and for Government use only.

The NAICS code for the work described below is 238320. The project will be unrestricted. The period of performance will be approximately 545 days. The estimated magnitude of this project is between $10,000,000 - $25,000,000. The Vertical Lift Railroad Bridge carries an active railroad track across the Cape Cod Canal Navigation Channel in the vicinity of Buzzards Bay in Massachusetts. The bridge, constructed in 1935 under the direction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, is a three-span bridge with one main moveable lift span which is flanked by a tower (257-foot tall) and approach span at each end. All spans are composed of bolted and riveted steel through trusses. The main lift span is 544 feet long and when in the raised position provides a vertical clearance of 136 feet above mean high water to accommodate vessel traffic below the bridge. The approach spans are 128 feet long.The scope of this project shall include blast cleaning all the metalwork of the bridge down to bare metal and application of a high-performance paint system. The preparation methods will likely include solvent cleaning (SSPC SP 1) to remove all visible oil, grease, and other contaminant residues followed by commercial blast cleaning (SSPC SP 6/NACE No.3). The paint system to be applied is anticipated to be a three-coat system. Potential bidders may refer to EM-385-1-1 for requirements related to abrasive blasting, air monitoring and full containment on USACE projects. In addition to the painting, there will be a limited number of steel repairs required on the structure at the towers and center span. The bridge will need to be properly balanced at all times. All use of tools or equipment that may affect the balance of the span will require the Contractor to furnish and install balance blocks on the Bridge counterweights.During the project, the navigation channel below the moveable span of the bridge will remain open. Additionally, the Railroad Bridge is required to remain functional to accommodate scheduled trains daily. The Mass Coastal Railroad utilizes the bridge to haul waste from Cape Cod typically six days a week. The State provides passenger rail service on weekends during the summer months. The passenger train typically requires the vertical lift bridge to operate six times per week from June to September. Potential bidders shall note that there will be significant coordination requirements with MBTA, the Mass Coastal Railroad as well as the Cape Cod Canal Marine Traffic Controller to successfully sequence the work of this project."

This regulation authorizes use of the sole source lease awards where it is determined that award to any other location would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition. THIS ADVERTISEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR LEASE PROPOSALS- However, any party who believes it can provide a facility that would satisfy the above requirements, is invited to submit a written statement of capability to do so, with evidence to support its claim. Responses received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this advertisement. This advertisement does not obligate the Government to award to any lease contract. The Department of Veterans Affairs currently occupies clinical and related space at 2900 Linden Lane Suite 100 Silver Spring MD 20910 in a lease that expires April 30, 2026 To satisfy the VA mission requirements, the current Silver Spring Vet Center must remain operational. Term: Estimated term is up to 15-years; up to 5-years firm term, 15-years soft term. Tenant Improvements: No tenant improvements will be performed under the succeeding lease award. Space Availability: The space must be available for occupancy by May 1, 2026 Rentable Square Feet: Approximately 2,896 Net Usable Square Feet (NUSF) / 3,454 ABOA / 3,909 Rentable Square Feet (RSF) of Medical Space. Location: To be considered, space must be within the following delineated area: North- MD-193 & MD-586, South- I-495 East- MD-97 West- MD-185 The Government will consider alternative space if it is economically advantageous, and that otherwise the Government intends to pursue a sole source acquisition.Â In making this determination, VA will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements as well as all costs likely to be incurred through relocating such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.Â VA will consider leased space located in another existing building providing all costs mentioned above can be offset by competition. Affirmative responses to this advertisement: Interested parties are invited to submit the above notice and evidence via email to melissa.chanduviholmes@va.gov no later than January 29, 2025 by 12:00 pm EST.
